Hak5 Pineapple
**************

A pentest meetup attendee demoed the `Hak5 Pineapple <http://hak5.org/?s=pineapple>`_, which can be used for MITM WiFi attacks. The hardware setup consisted of: a pineapple, two additional (powerful) USB-based antennas, and a connecting USB hub providing power. One antenna capable of injection was used for deauth, the second capable of master mode used for an access point, while the on-board antenna was used to connect to the upstream wifi router. (One antenna capable of both injection and master mode could replace these antennas.) The pineapple web-based interface can be used to configure targeted MITM attacks. Consult the `Hak5 Pineapple <http://hak5.org/?s=pineapple>`_ site for device configuration details.
