From the `aircrack-ng`_ site:

  Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.

  In fact, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.

You can experiment using a home test suite for ``aircrack-ng``:

* Dedicated testing router: under $20 wireless routers are routinely available (so you don't have to mess up your own or neighbor's home router)
* Wireless client: a cell phone can be a wireless client
* Pen test machine:

  * Any laptop capable of running `Kali Linux`_
  * Or a desktop with powerful ~$30 Alfa USB wireless card
  * Or a virtual machine running on one of the above

To study ``aircrack-ng`` start by running Kali's ``wifite`` command (a python script automating ``aircrack-ng`` usage). `aircrack-ng tutorials <http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=tutorial>`_ contain useful networking howto's. Additionally, view `SecurityTube`_ `aircrack-ng`_ videos:

* `Wireless LAN Security and Penetration Testing Megaprimer <http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=9>`_ provides a thorough, theoretical, and hands-on introduction to wireless penetration testing.

* `Security Tube aircrack-ng videos <http://www.securitytube.net/tags/aircrack-ng>`_ (especially the *Aircrack-Ng Megaprimer*, which provides a detailed introduction to the aircrack-ng commands).
