`Burp Suite`_ and `ZAP`_
************************

Virtually all the exploits are written up using command line tools only. However, web exploits are usually first investigated using GUI tools like web browsers and intercepting proxies like `Burp Suite`_ and `ZAP`_.

`Burp Suite Editions <http://portswigger.net/burp/editions.html>`_ has free and professional editions. The free edition provides: an intercepting proxy; an application-aware spider; a repeater tool allowing request manipulation and resend; and some additional tools. It lacks a scanner, has some speed limitations, and lacks a save/restore feature.

`ZAP`_ is an `OWASP`_ open source "integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications". Consult the web site for documentation.


Burp Suite
==========

Burp Suite Setup
----------------

You can start Burp Suite as ``burpsuite`` from the command line or the gui :menuselection:`Kali Linux --> Web Applications --> Web Application Proxies --> burpsuite`.

Installing Burp's CA Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow `Installing Burp's CA Certificate <http://portswigger.net/burp/help/proxy_options_installingCAcert.html>`_ to install the Burp Suite CA certificate:

  By default, when you browse an HTTPS website via Burp, the Proxy generates an SSL certificate for each host, signed by its own Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. This CA certificate is generated the first time Burp is run, and stored locally. To use Burp Proxy most effectively with HTTPS websites, you will need to install Burp's CA certificate as a trusted root in your browser.

The certificate installation instructions also show how to `Configure Your Browser <http://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html#browser>`_ to use the Burp Suite proxy.

Proxy Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select :guilabel:`Proxy` then :guilabel:`Options`. Under :guilabel:`Proxy Listeners` select :guilabel:`Proxy`; then under :guilabel:`Intercept Server Responses` select all but status code not matching ^304$.

Intercept On/Off
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember to turn the proxy intercept on/off as desired on the :guilabel:`Intercept is on/off` button, located on the :guilabel:`Proxy` & :guilabel:`Intercept` tabs. Pentesters have left in on and wondered why their web browser hangs.


ZAP
===

ZAP Setup
---------

You can start ZAP as ``owasp-zap`` from the command line or the gui :menuselection:`Kali Linux --> Web Applications --> Web Application Proxies --> owasp-zap`.

Installing ZAP's CA Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow `Adding SSL Certificates from OWASP ZAP - A Visual Walkthrough <http://2buntu.com/articles/1517/adding-ssl-certificates-from-owasp-zap-a-visual-walkthrough/>`_. Basically, run ``owasp-zap`` then :menuselection:`Tools --> Options... --> Options --> Dynamic SSL Certificates --> Generate (only if there is no Root CA certificate) --> Save --> Save --> OK` to export the ZAP Root CA. Next import it into Iceweasel via :menuselection:`Preferences --> Advanced --> Certificates --> View Certificates --> Import... --> browse to & select exported ZAP Root CA --> Open --> select all "Trust this CA ..." checkboxes --> OK --> OK --> Close`. This will eliminate the constant SSL error messages when using ZAP.

Managing Add-ons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run ``owasp-zap`` then :menuselection:`Help --> Check for Updates... --> Marketplace` to view and select add-ons for installation. Use :menuselection:`Help --> Check for Updates... --> Installed` to check for updates to installed add-ons.
