DriveDroid & Kon-Boot
*********************

A pentest meetup attendee demonstrated gaining access to a Windows 8 PC's unencrypted disk using their Android phone and a USB cable. It requires physical access to the PC and rebooting the PC to the boot image stored on the Android phone; then the PC's disk can be accessed using the booted OS. The is little physical evidence left (outside an unscheduled reboot).

There were 2 software packages used:

* `DriveDroid <http://softwarebakery.com/projects/drivedroid>`_ "is an Android application that allows you to boot your PC from ISO/IMG files stored on your phone." There is a free, limited version of DriveDroid.

* `Kon-Boot <http://www.piotrbania.com/all/kon-boot/>`_ provided the ISO/USB image used to boot the target computer. Kon-Boot can generate an ISO image for non-EFI computers, and a USB stick for EFI computers (which must be configured to not use the secure boot option). The currently free Kon-Boot version does not support 64 bit systems, Windows 7/8, nor EFI systems (which leaves 32 bit Windows XP).

So Kon-Boot is used to generate the boot image, which is transferred to the Android phone, which is plugged into the computer, which is rebooted to the Kon-Boot image (possibly requiring disabling EFI secure boot). Once booted the PC's unencrypted disks can be accessed. Cleanup consists of another reboot (possibly re-enabling the EFI secure boot if it was disabled).
