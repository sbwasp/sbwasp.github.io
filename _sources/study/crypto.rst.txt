Cryptography basics
===================


Cryptography terms
------------------

Here are a few key terms to understand:

Public/private keypair
  A pair of keys mathematically related so that encryption with one key can be decrypted with the other. Encrypt data with a user's public key so only they can decrypt it with their private key. Digitally sign data using your private key so anyone can use your public key to validate that signature.

Symmetric encryption
  Encryption (plaintext ==> ciphertext) using a key that also decrypts (ciphertext ==> plaintext) the data.

Asymmetric encryption
  Encryption using a public key that can only be decrypted with the matching private key. Generally much slower than symmetric key.

Diffie-Hellman
  `Diffie-Hellman key exchange <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange>`_ "is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel ... . Traditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical channel, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher."

(Perfect) Forward Secrecy
  `Forward secrecy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy>`_ "also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a property of secure communication protocols in which compromises of long-term keys do not compromise past session keys. ... If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle attack."

Cryptographic hash
  A hash is a math algorithm to convert arbitrary length input into a fixed length bit string. A cryptographic hash should be: difficult to reverse; small input changes produce vast, uncorrelated output changes; and not produce the same hash value for different inputs.

Salt
  Rather than hash a value (like a password), the password plus another value called the salt are hashed. The idea is that 2 users with the same password would have different password hashes because they use different salts.

Pepper
  From `Pepper (cryptography) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)>`_:

    In cryptography, a pepper is a secret added to an input such as a password prior to being hashed with a cryptographic hash function. A pepper performs a similar role to a salt, but while a salt is stored alongside the hashed output, a pepper is not.

Fast hash vs. slow hash
  `Differences Between Fast Hashes and Slow Hashes <http://openwall.info/wiki/john/essays/fast-and-slow-hashes>`_ differentiates between fast hashes used for MACs (message authentication codes), digital signatures, and checksums vs slow hashes for password storage (like ``scrypt`` and ``argon2``). The article compares NT MD4 hashes at 30,302K c/s (crack attempts per second) vs Blowfish at 5,724 c/s (over 5000x faster). The 2010 article `How To Safely Store A Password <https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/>`_ mentions $300/hour cracking 500,000,000,000 candidate (weak) password hashes a second, with computing resources now being not only faster but cheaper.


Diffie-Hellman and RSA public key cryptography
----------------------------------------------


Diffie-Hellman
--------------

See `Diffie-Hellman Protocol <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Diffie-HellmanProtocol.html>`_ or `"Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange" in plain English <https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45963/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-in-plain-english>`_. For a nice set of slides see `Foundations of Computer Security Lecture 52: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange <https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361/lecture52.pdf>`_.


RSA public key cryptography
---------------------------

See `The Mathematics of the RSA Public-Key Cryptosystem <http://www.mathaware.org/mam/06/Kaliski.pdf>`_ for a short description of RSA public key cryptography. Our meetup will follow that writeup so website readers should do that now. A key point from there is:

  The input m is the message; the output c is the resulting ciphertext. In practice, the message m is typically some kind of appropriately formatted key to be shared. The actual message is encrypted with the shared key using a traditional encryption algorithm. This construction makes it possible to encrypt a message of any length with only one exponentiation.

As for the math:

  An RSA public-key / private-key pair can be generated by the following steps:

  #. Generate a pair of large, random primes p and q.
  #. Compute the modulus n as n = pq.
  #. Select an odd public exponent e between 3 and n-1 that is relatively prime to p-1 and q-1.
  #. Compute the private exponent d from e, p and q. (See below.)
  #. Output (n, e) as the public key and (n, d) as the private key.

  The encryption operation in the RSA cryptosystem is exponentiation to the e th power modulo n:
    c = ENCRYPT (m) = m**e mod n. 
    
  The decryption operation is exponentiation to the dth power modulo n:
    m = DECRYPT (c) = c**d mod n. 

Traditionally, cryptography used a shared symmetric encryption key, and today most encryption is done using that too. But to exchange that symmetric key requires using something like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange based on public/private keys. For example, SSH encryption uses a symmetric key to encrypt the data, while the public/private keys are used to digitally sign the key exchange. The OpenSSH public/private keys are not used to encrypt!

Here are some very short alternate RSA articles: `Public Key Cryptography <https://nrich.maths.org/2200>`_, `RSA Encryption <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RSAEncryption.html>`_, and `Simplest explanation of the math behind Public Key Cryptography <https://www.onebigfluke.com/2013/11/public-key-crypto-math-explained.html>`_.


PKCS standards
==============

From `PKCS`_ there are PKCS #1 - #15, though not all are active. We will be concerned with the ones we see in usage:

ASN.1
  `ASN.1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One>`_ "is an interface description language for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a standard, cross-platform way. It's broadly used in the telecommunications and computer networking, and especially in cryptography."

  From `X.690 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690>`_:

    `DER <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding>`_ is a subset of `BER <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding>`_ providing for exactly one way to encode an ASN.1 value. DER is intended for situations when a unique encoding is needed, such as in cryptography, and ensures that a data structure that needs to be digitally signed produces a unique serialized representation.

  From `PKCS`_:

    The `PEM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`_ format is often used to encapsulate DER-encoded ASN.1 certificates and keys in an ASCII-only format. The PEM version of a DER message consists of the base64 encoding of the DER message, preceded by "-----BEGIN FOO-----" and followed by "-----END FOO-----", where "FOO" may indicate "CERTIFICATE", "PUBLIC KEY", "PRIVATE KEY" or many other types of content.

PKCS #1
  PKCS #1 defines the RSA algorithm and the public and private keys. `RFC 8017`_ *PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2* is the current RFC.

PKCS #5
  PKCS #5 defines implementations of password-based cryptography.

PKCS #7
  PKCS #7 as defined in `RFC 2315`_ *PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax Version 1.5* defines how to sign and encrypt messages in a PKI. This can be a response to a PKCS #10 request.

PKCS #8
  `PKCS #8 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8>`_ "is a standard syntax for storing private key information" defined in `RFC 5958`_ *Asymmetric Key Packages*. "The PKCS #8 private key may be encrypted with a passphrase using the PKCS #5 standards, which supports multiple ciphers. The PKCS #8 private keys are typically exchanged in the PEM base64-encoded format."

PKCS #10
  PKCS #10 is the certification request standard as defined in `RFC 2986`_ *PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7* as updated by `RFC 5967`_ *The application/pkcs10 Media Type*.

PKCS #11
  `PKCS #11 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11>`_ 'defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSM) and smart cards, and names the API itself "Cryptoki"'.

PKCS #12
  `PKCS #12 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12>`_ "defines an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects as a single file. It is commonly used to bundle a private key with its X.509 certificate or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust. A PKCS #12 file may be encrypted and signed. ... The filename extension for PKCS #12 files is ``.p12`` or ``.pfx``."

X.509
  From `X.509`_:

    X.509 is a standard that defines the format of public key certificates. X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web.

ASN.1
=====


ASN.1 is complicated
--------------------

ASN.1 is defined by `ITU-T <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T>`_ documents X.6**, where ** = 80-83, 90-97. Visit `X Series <https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/en>`_ for links leading to downloads. `ITU-T X.690 <https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.690-201508-I/en>`_ is perhaps the best skim, but not recommended.

Instead, it's much easier to use tools like `OpenSSL asn1parse <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/apps/asn1parse.html>`_ to parse the ASN.1 format. Look at `How can I transform between the two styles of public key format, one "BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY", the other is "BEGIN PUBLIC KEY" <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18039401/how-can-i-transform-between-the-two-styles-of-public-key-format-one-begin-rsa>`_. The answer by Ian Boyd is a good read to see the byte-by-byte ASN.1 encoding. However, the much shorter answer by Vincent Povirk shows that if you know some basic information (like PKCS #1 vs #8) you can simply use ``openssl`` to convert formats. 


RSA public/private keys as examples
-----------------------------------

As mentioned above, ASN.1 is used to serialize and deserialize data. For cryptography, that means serializing/deserializing DER data to be stored in PEM format. For an example we'll show RSA public/private key storage based on their definition in `RFC 8017 - PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2 - Appendix A. ASN.1 Syntax <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#appendix-A>`_.

The private key format is:

.. code-block:: text
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      version           Version,
      modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
      publicExponent    INTEGER,  -- e
      privateExponent   INTEGER,  -- d
      prime1            INTEGER,  -- p
      prime2            INTEGER,  -- q
      exponent1         INTEGER,  -- d mod (p-1)
      exponent2         INTEGER,  -- d mod (q-1)
      coefficient       INTEGER,  -- (inverse of q) mod p
      otherPrimeInfos   OtherPrimeInfos OPTIONAL
  }

And the public key format is:

.. code-block:: text
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
      publicExponent    INTEGER   -- e
  }


First create a PKCS-1 RSA PEM-encoded private key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we'll generate a key using ``openssl`` then use ``openssl asn1parse`` to show it is stored as PKCS #1 PEM:

Extract PKCS #1 public key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now extract the PKCS #1 public key:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,5,9

  # Extract PKCS #1 public key in both PEM and DER formats
  openssl rsa -in rsa.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out public-pk1.pem
  openssl rsa -in rsa.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -outform DER -out public-pk1.der

  # Visually show the base64-decoded PEM is equivalent to DER
  grep -v -- '-----' public-pk1.pem | base64 -d | xxd
  xxd public-pk1.der

  # Let the computer test equivalence
  grep -v -- '-----' public-pk1.pem | base64 -d > public-pk1.bin
  diff public-pk1.bin public-pk1.der && echo "base64 -d PEM = DER"


Extract PKCS #8 public key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now extract the PKCS #8 public key:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,5,9,13

  # Extract PKCS #8 public key in both PEM and DER formats
  openssl rsa -in rsa.pem -pubout -out public-pk8.pem
  openssl rsa -in rsa.pem -pubout -outform DER -out public-pk8.der

  # Show the PEM/DER formats store the same information
  openssl pkey -pubin -in public-pk8.pem -text -noout
  openssl pkey -pubin -in public-pk8.der -inform DER -text -noout

  # Show the base64-decoded PEM is equivalent to DER
  grep -v -- '-----' public-pk8.pem | base64 -d | xxd
  xxd public-pk8.pem

  # Show equivalence a different way
  grep -v -- '-----' public-pk8.pem | base64 -d > public.bin
  diff public.bin public-pk8.der && echo "base64 -d PEM = DER"


Show PKCS #1 RSA public keys match RSA RFC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's parse the PKCS #1 RSA public keys to show their format is exactly that of the PKCS #1 RSA standard:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4,9,12

  wc -c public-pk1.der
  # 270 public-pk1.der

  openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in public-pk1.der
  #     0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #     4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :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
  #   265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001

  wc -c public-pk1.pem
  # 426 public-pk1.pem

  openssl asn1parse -inform PEM -in public-pk1.pem
  #     0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #     4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :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
  #   265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001


Show PKCS #8 RSA public keys match PKCS #8 RFC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's parse the PKCS #8 DER format. We'll have to do 2 asn1parse's, the first to expose the PKCS #8 encryption packaging, then delve into the PKCS #1 RSA format:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 2-3,9-10

  wc -c public-pk8.der
  # Show PKCS #8 packaging
  openssl asn1parse -inform DER -in public-pk8.der
  #    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 290 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #    4:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #    6:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :rsaEncryption
  #   17:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL              
  #   19:d=1  hl=4 l= 271 prim: BIT STRING        
  # Show PKCS #1 by skipping PKCS #8 packaging to BIT STRING
  openssl asn1parse -strparse 19 -inform DER -in public-pk8.der
  #    0:d=0  hl=4 l= 266 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #    4:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim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
  #  265:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001

The website `ASN.1 JavaScript decoder <https://lapo.it/asn1js/>`_ does the two parses in one step, resulting in:

.. code-block:: text

  SEQUENCE(2 elem)
    SEQUENCE(2 elem)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER1.2.840.113549.1.1.1rsaEncryption(PKCS #1)

      INTEGER65537


Visually seeing the PKCS #1 vs #8 difference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first line of the PEM files shows the difference:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,6

  head -n 1 public-pk1.pem public-pk8.pem
  # ==> public-pk1.pem <==
  # -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
  # 
  # ==> public-pk8.pem <==
  # -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----


OpenSSH keys
============


OpenSSH concepts
----------------


Creating and using SSH keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `arch linux SSH keys <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys>`_ for SSH key usage. See `Secure Secure Shell <https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html>`_ for hardening SSH crypto (as opposed to general hardening of SSH).


DH key exchange (with signatures)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH uses 2 algorithms:

* Key exchange algorithm yielding a secret key (used to encrypt session data):

  * Diffie-Hellman

  * ECDH (elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman)

    * NIST curve P-256
    * Curve25519

* Signature algorithm

  * Uses DSA, RSA, or one of elliptic curve algorithm ECDSA (P-256) or Ed25519 (Curve25519)

`RFC 8032`_ *Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)* describes the new Ed25519 algorithm.  Ed25519 is really Ed25519-SHA-512 as the signature algorithm is based on SHA-512. See `RFC 8032 5.1.  Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1>`_ for a detailed description of Ed25519, including *5.1.5 Key Generation*, *5.1.6 Sign*, and *5.1.7 Verify*.


SSH steps
^^^^^^^^^

`RFC 4253`_ *The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol* describes SSH `RFC 4253 7. Key Exchange <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-7>`_, `RFC 4253 8.  Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-8>`_, and `RFC 4253 9.  Key Re-Exchange <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-9>`_ details.

Here's an overly-simplified version:

* The SSH server uses the :file:`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to identify the public keys of users allowed to authenticate as a particular user. This file is populated as part of user setup and maintained by the user.

* The SSH client uses :file:`~/.ssh/known_hosts` file to identify the public keys of servers. Servers are added upon first connection to the server (with user concurrence).

* When the client attempts to connect, the server SSH key is checked against :file:`~/.ssh/known_hosts` and either added if not there, or validated (and the connection rejected if no match). The server checks the user's public key against the :file:`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and rejects connections if not there.

* Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm has an authenticated version using the asymmetric key pairs of both parties for signing the exchanged DH data. That way both parties are assured that the other party has the matching private key.

* DH yields a symmetric key for encrypting the session. Note that up to this point nothing has been encrypted.

* The public/private key pair is not used for encryption, just digital signature. So DH provides Forward Secrecy: stealing the private keys does not allow recreating the session key.


OpenSSH key formats
-------------------

Generate SSH RSA keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's generate the older and newer RSA OpenSSH keys, plus the newer Ed25519 OpenSSH keys:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-2,4-

  # Note: exported public key formats are PEM (PKCS #1), RFC 4716, and PKCS8
  # Note: key types are dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa | rsa1

  # Generate rsa old, rsa new "-o", and ed25519 (only new format allowed)
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment" -N "" -f id_rsa
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comment" -N "" -o -f id-o_rsa
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "comment" -N "" -f id_ed25519

Look at RSA public key format (old SSH keys)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's look at the RSA public key format for the old SSH key format:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,6-7,8,21,35

  # Convert to PEM (PKCS #1), RFC4716, and PKCS8
  ssh-keygen -e -m PEM -f id_rsa > id_rsa_pem.pub
  ssh-keygen -e -m RFC4716 -f id_rsa > id_rsa_4716.pub
  ssh-keygen -e -m PKCS8 -f id_rsa > id_rsa_pk8.pub

  # See the visual differences
  cat id_rsa_pem.pub id_rsa_4716.pub id_rsa_pk8.pub

`RFC 4716`_ *The Secure Shell (SSH) Public Key File Format* defines the public key format as:

* Begins with "---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----" and ends with "---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----"

* Header fields "Header-tag ':' ' ' Header-value"

* base64-encoded body with binary data

  * string identifying public key format (here "ssh-rsa", but "ssh-dss", "pgp-sign-rsa", "pgp-sign-dss", ... are possible)

  * bytes of key data, which for rsa are a modulus and exponent

Look at ed25519 public key format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ed25519 public key format is only supported for RFC4716, not PEM or PKCS8:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4-6

  # Convert to RFC4716 (default) only, no PEM (PKCS #1) or PKCS8
  ssh-keygen -e -f id_ed25519 > id_ed25519_4716.pub
  
  # See it looks like the rsa RFC4716 keys except it is very small
  cat id_ed25519_4716.pub
  # ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
  # Comment: "256-bit ED25519, converted by oresama@meetup from OpenSSH"
  # AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIFEjKv4B22JRXTnTiyCYwsIpwiAg0l703wcWXL8sd6MQ
  # ---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----

Pick apart the RFC4716 format to see lack of ASN.1 encoding, then the 32 byte public key (basically the SHA-512 hash of the 256 bit private key plus some more manipulation as described in `RFC 8032 5.1.5. Key Generation <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5>`_):

Self-signed server certificates
===============================


Generating and using self-signed certificates
---------------------------------------------

We'll mostly follow `Securing Traffic Between two Socat Instances Using SSL <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat-openssltunnel.html>`_ to illustrate both creating self-signed certificates then using them to mutually verify both ends of a TLS connection.

Here we'll generate a self-signed certificate to anaylyze the resulting keys:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,6,9,15

  # Server certificate
  FILENAME=server
  SUBJ="/C=US/ST=California/L=Redondo Beach/O=SBWASP/OU=Meetup/CN=sbwasp.bitbender.org"
  # Create PEM format private key
  #   = base64 encoded DER format (compatible with PKCS#10) with header/footer lines.
  # Private key is 2048 bit RSA, not encrypted.
  openssl genrsa -out $FILENAME.key 2048
  openssl rsa -in $FILENAME.key -text
  # Generate self-signed X.509 certificate using just-generated private key
  openssl req -new -key $FILENAME.key -x509 -days 3653 -out $FILENAME.crt -subj "$SUBJ"
  openssl x509 -in $FILENAME.crt -text
  cat $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.crt >$FILENAME.pem
  chmod 600 $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.pem
  
  # Client certificate
  FILENAME=client
  SUBJ="/C=US/ST=California/L=Redondo Beach/O=SBWASP/OU=Meetup/CN=oresama@bitbender.org"
  openssl genrsa -out $FILENAME.key  2048
  openssl req -new -key $FILENAME.key -x509 -days 3653 -out $FILENAME.crt -subj "$SUBJ"
  cat $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.crt >$FILENAME.pem
  chmod 600 $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.pem


Picking apart the server certificates
-------------------------------------


Server PKCS #1 key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server key is just an PKCS #1 RSA private key (see `RFC 8017 A.1.2. RSA Private Key Syntax <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#appendix-A.1.2>`_:

Using the self-signed certificates
----------------------------------

Now that we have the certificates, fire up the server in it's own terminal window. It will just echo back the request:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,5

  # Server listens to 1 client at a time (use fork for more)
  CERTDIR=$HOME/tmp
  cd $CERTDIR
  sudo apt install socat -y  < /dev/null
  socat openssl-listen:8080,reuseaddr,cert=$CERTDIR/server.pem,cafile=$CERTDIR/client.crt echo
  # Alternatively a shell command could be run
  # socat openssl-listen:8080,fork,reuseaddr,cert=$CERTDIR/server.pem,cafile=$CERTDIR/client.crt exec:"ip addr show"

In another window fire up the client:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4-

  # Client connects by running any old shell command to get echo'ed back
  CERTDIR=$HOME/tmp
  cd $CERTDIR
  ls | \
    socat stdio openssl-connect:sbwasp.bitbender.org:8080,cert=$CERTDIR/client.pem,cafile=$CERTDIR/server.crt

The client will see whatever was generated by ``ls`` echoed back, or the results of the ``ip addr show`` command if that was selected. Terminate any running processes in the 2 terminal windows.

Now we'll demonstrate how to use the certificate just generated to serve web pages:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,8-

  # Try website TLS1.2 encryption using the server certificate
  #   Any web content will do.
  # Fire up the HTTP server on port 8000 (it could be restricted to localhost).
  CERTDIR=$HOME/tmp
  WEBSITE=$CERTDIR/web
  mkdir -p $WEBSITE
  echo "hello" > $WEBSITE/index.html
  (cd $WEBSITE; python3 -m http.server 8000) &
  # Now fire up socat to provide the TLS1.2
  socat -s openssl-listen:8080,method=TLS1.2,fork,reuseaddr,keepalive,verify=0,cert=$CERTDIR/server.pem tcp:localhost:8000

Now fire up any web browser or use ``curl`` to test the TLS1.2 encryption:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3

  # Show curl fails when certificate checked (the default)
  curl https://sbwasp.bitbender.org:8080
  # Show curl succeeds using TLS1.2 when certificate not verified
  curl --insecure --verbose --output /dev/null  https://sbwasp.bitbender.org:8080

Alternatives ``curl`` to check the certificate details are a browser or ``openssl s_client``:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  echo -ne "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: sbwasp.bitbender.org\n\n\n\n" | \
      openssl s_client -connect sbwasp.bitbender.org:8080

Kill the extra listenting processes (``sudo ss -tnlp`` will show the PIDs to ``kill``).


Let's Encrypt certificates
==========================


Creating Let's Encrypt certificates via :program:`dehydrated`
-------------------------------------------------------------


Installing :program:`dehydrated`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`dehydrated <https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated>`_ depends on ``openssl``, ``curl``, ``sed``, ``grep``, and ``mktemp``. It can be installed manually from GitHub or via a Debian package. We'll use GitHub, but those using Debian 9 should install ``dehydrated`` from stretch-backports:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4-

  cat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backport.list
  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-backports main
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-backports main
  EOF
  sudo apt update  < /dev/null
  sudo apt -t stretch-backports dehydrated -y  < /dev/null

Since the demo install is a throw-away, we'll clone ``dehydrated`` from GitHub into a temporary directory:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 5

  # Pick a configuration directory based on who is running it
  CDIR=$HOME/tmp
  cd $CDIR/
  sudo apt install git -y  < /dev/null
  git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated.git


Configuring :program:`dehydrated`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuring ``dehydrated`` involves modifying 3 files:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,5,8-10,11,20-22,24,76

  # Create a website
  WEBSITE=$CDIR/web
  mkdir -p $WEBSITE
  echo "hello" > $WEBSITE/index.html
  # Pick a configuration directory based on who is running it
  cd $CDIR/
  cp $CDIR/dehydrated/docs/examples/{config,domains.txt,hook.sh} $CDIR/
  # domains.txt
  #   Each line is a certificate, first domain is cert name, rest are aliases.
  echo "sbwasp.bitbender.org" > domains.txt
  # config used for command defaults - likely make these changes:
  sed -i 's|^#BASEDIR.*$|BASEDIR='$CDIR'|' config
  sed -i 's/^#CHALLENGETYPE="http-01"/CHALLENGETYPE="http-01"/' config
  # Note - for AWS CloudFront set KEYSIZE="2048"
  sed -i 's|^#WELLKNOWN=.*$|WELLKNOWN='$WEBSITE'/.well-known/acme-challenge|' config
  mkdir -p $WEBSITE/.well-known/acme-challenge
  sed -i 's|^#HOOK=.*$|HOOK="$BASEDIR/hook.sh"|' config
  sed -i 's/^#PRIVATE_KEY_RENEW=.*$/PRIVATE_KEY_RENEW="no"/' config

  # The most significant part is hooks.sh configuration of:
  #   deploy_challenge() - copy challenge to $WEBSITE/.well-known/acme-challenge/...
  #   deploy_cert() - socat -s openssl-listen:8080,...,cert=NEWCERT,...

  cat > hook.sh <<'EOF'
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  deploy_challenge() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" TOKEN_FILENAME="${2}" TOKEN_VALUE="${3}"
      echo "$TOKEN_VALUE" > $WELLKNOWN/$TOKEN_FILENAME
  }
  
  clean_challenge() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" TOKEN_FILENAME="${2}" TOKEN_VALUE="${3}"
      rm -f $WELLKNOWN/$TOKEN_FILENAME
  }
  
  deploy_cert() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" KEYFILE="${2}" CERTFILE="${3}" FULLCHAINFILE="${4}" CHAINFILE="${5}" TIMESTAMP="${6}"
      # Deploying a cert using socat is just creating a new server cert:
      # cat $KEYFILE $CERTFILE $CHAINFILE > $CERTDIR/server_le.pem
      # To use it restart socat something like
      # ( sudo socat openssl-listen:443,fork,reuseaddr,keepalive,method=TLS1.2,cert=$CERTDIR/server_le.pem,verify=0 tcp:localhost:8000 )&
  }
  
  unchanged_cert() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" KEYFILE="${2}" CERTFILE="${3}" FULLCHAINFILE="${4}" CHAINFILE="${5}"
  }
  
  invalid_challenge() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" RESPONSE="${2}"
      echo "Subject: Validation of ${DOMAIN} failed!\n\nOh noez!"
  }
  
  request_failure() {
      local STATUSCODE="${1}" REASON="${2}" REQTYPE="${3}" HEADERS="${4}"
      echo "Subject: HTTP request failed failed!\n\nA http request failed with status ${STATUSCODE}!"
  }
  
  generate_csr() {
      local DOMAIN="${1}" CERTDIR="${2}" ALTNAMES="${3}"
      echo "generater_csr() call"
  }
  
  startup_hook() {
    :
  }
  
  exit_hook() {
    :
  }
  
  HANDLER="$1"; shift
  if [[ "${HANDLER}" =~ ^(deploy_challenge|clean_challenge|deploy_cert|unchanged_cert|invalid_challenge|request_failure|generate_csr|startup_hook|exit_hook)$ ]]; then
    "$HANDLER" "$@"
  fi
  EOF


Test configuration using Let's Encrypt staging server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request the certificate from the staging server:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4,8

  # Use staging server
  sed -i 's|^#*CA=.*$|CA="https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"|' config

  # Redirect port 80 to 8000
  (cd $WEBSITE; python3 -m http.server 8000)&
  (sudo socat tcp-listen:80,fork,reuseaddr,keepalive tcp:localhost:8000)&

  # Make the request
  dehydrated/dehydrated -c --config ./config --accept-terms --ipv4


Let's Encrypt certificate request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request the certificate from the operational server:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,4

  # Now ready for operational server
  sed -i 's|^#*CA=.*$|CA="https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"|' config

  # Make the request
  dehydrated/dehydrated -c --config ./config --accept-terms --ipv4

Assuming the cert request succeeds you can test it:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  LEDIR=$CERTDIR/certs/sbwasp.bitbender.org
  cat $LEDIR/privkey.pem $LEDIR/cert.pem $LEDIR/chain.pem > server_le.pem
  (sudo socat openssl-listen:443,fork,reuseaddr,keepalive,method=TLS1.2,cert=$CERTDIR/server_le.pem tcp:localhost:8000)&
  curl --verbose --output /dev/null  https://sbwasp.bitbender.org

When done use ``sudo ss -tnlp`` and ``sudo kill`` to cleanup background processes.


Picking apart the Let's Encrypt certificates
--------------------------------------------


Starting with a private key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A certificate request must start with a private key, which in this case is RSA PKCS #1 (with actual values redacted):

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,12

  openssl asn1parse -in privkey.pem
  #     0:d=0  hl=4 l=2344 cons: SEQUENCE          
  #     4:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :00
  #     7:d=1  hl=4 l= 513 prim: INTEGER           :AA...
  #   524:d=1  hl=2 l=   3 prim: INTEGER           :010001
  #   529:d=1  hl=4 l= 512 prim: INTEGER           :AA...
  #  1045:d=1  hl=4 l= 257 prim: INTEGER           :AA...

  #  1828:d=1  hl=4 l= 256 prim: INTEGER           :AA...
  #  2088:d=1  hl=4 l= 256 prim: INTEGER           :AA...
  openssl rsa -text -noout -in privkey.pem
  # Private-Key: (4096 bit)
  # modulus:

  #     00:...
  # exponent1:
  #     00:...
  # exponent2:
  #     AA:...
  # coefficient:
  #     AA:...


Certification request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the private key, a PKCS #10 certification signing request is created which has the `RFC 2986 4. Certification request syntax <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986#section-4>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,28,34

  # Show PKCS #10
  openssl asn1parse -in cert.csr
  #     0:d=0  hl=4 l=1174 cons: SEQUENCE

This certificate is not a private key so not PKCS #8, nor is it a certification request so not PKCS #10, and it's not PKCS #7 or PKCS #12 format:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3

  openssl pkcs7 -in cert.pem -print -noout
  # unable to load PKCS7 object
  openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -info
  # ERRORS

But we can create a PKCS #7 from :file:`cert.pem` and :file:`chain.pem` (that doesn't have :file:`privkey.pem`):

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-2

  openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile cert.pem -out cert.p7b -certfile chain.pem
  openssl pkcs7 -in cert.p7b -print -noout

We can extract the private key from  PKCS #12 then convert it to PKCS #8:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-3

  # 2 steps to get PKCS #8 private key
  openssl pkcs12 -in full.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out temp.pem -passin pass:somepassword
  openssl pkcs8 -in temp.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -out privkey.pk8
  rm temp.pem


The Let's Encrypt certificate and chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's Encrypt provides :file:`chain.pem` (Let's Encrypt X.509 certificate) and :file:`fullchain.pem` (concatenation of :file:`cert.pem` and :file:`chain.pem`):

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,5

  # Show X.509 via asn1parse
  grep -v -E -- ':|^----' chain.pem | openssl asn1parse
  # Then X.509 contents
  openssl x509 -in chain.pem -text -noout
  # Then show cert.pem + chain.pem = fullchain.pem
  cat cert.pem chain.pem | diff fullchain.pem -


Analyzing an arbitrary website certificate
------------------------------------------


Downloading a website cert
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Web browsers allow downloading the certificate, but to automate that use ``openssl s_client``:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 4-5

  WEBSITE=marengosystems.org
  PORT=443

  openssl s_client -servername $WEBSITE -connect $WEBSITE:$PORT  < /dev/null 2>&1 | \
      sed -ne '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | \
      tee $WEBSITE.pem


Analyzing the website cert
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we simply use ``openssl x509`` to view the certificate:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  openssl x509 -in $WEBSITE.pem -text -noout


Viewing the certificate chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the certificate chain use ``openssl x509 -showcerts``:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 3

  WEBSITE=sbwasp.github.io
  PORT=443
  openssl s_client -showcerts -servername $WEBSITE -connect $WEBSITE:$PORT  < /dev/null


Cryptographic hashes
====================


What's a cryptographic hash?
----------------------------

From `Cryptographic hash function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function>`_:

  A **cryptographic hash function** is a special class of `hash function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>`_ that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in `cryptography <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography>`_. It is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash) and is designed to be a one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert.

  The ideal cryptographic hash function has five main properties:

  * it is deterministic so the same message always results in the same hash

  * it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message

  * it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages

  * a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value

  * it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value

  Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in `digital signatures <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature>`_, `message authentication codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_codes>`_ (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary `hash functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>`_, to index data in `hash tables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table>`_, for `fingerprinting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)>`_, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as `checksums <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum>`_ to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (*digital*) *fingerprints*, *checksums*, or just *hash values*, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.


Salting hashes
--------------

From `Salt (cryptography) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)>`_:

  a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that "hashes" data, a password or passphrase. Salts are closely related to the concept of nonce. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks or against its hashed equivalent, a pre-computed rainbow table attack.


Secure Hash Algorithms
----------------------

The `National Institute of Standards and Technology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology>`_ publishes `Secure Hash Algorithms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms>`_ as a US `Federal Information Processing Standards <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards>`_: SHA-1, `SHA-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2>`_ (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256), `SHA-3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3>`_ (SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE128, and SHAKE256).


Comparison of cryptographic hash functions
------------------------------------------

See `Comparison of cryptographic hash functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptographic_hash_functions>`_ for a detailed analysis.


Key derivation functions
------------------------

A `Key derivation function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function>`_:

  derives one or more secret keys from a secret value such as a master key, a password, or a passphrase using a pseudorandom function. KDFs can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys of a required format, such as converting a group element that is the result of a Diffie–Hellman key exchange into a symmetric key for use with AES.

`PBKDF2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2>`_:

  is part of RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series, specifically PKCS #5 v2.0, also published as Internet Engineering Task Force's RFC 2898. It supersedes PBKDF1, which could only produce derived keys up to 160 bits long. RFC 8018, published in 2017, still recommends PBKDF2 for password hashing, even though newer password hashing functions such as Argon2 are designed to address weaknesses in older functions such as PBKDF2.

`bcrypt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt>`_ is an older password hashing function, `scrypt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt>`_, and `Argon2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>`_ are attempts to make key derivation functions more resistant to cracking.

From `Password Hashing: PBKDF2, Scrypt, Bcrypt <https://medium.com/@mpreziuso/password-hashing-pbkdf2-scrypt-bcrypt-1ef4bb9c19b3>`_:

  In 2015, if you’re storing passwords I hope that we’re already assuming that you’re going to store the hashed version of them. The hashing process is a one-way process which given some data it turns that into an unique string of fixed length. And that process will always return that string for that data. This allows a system to check the validity of a password with no knowledge of the original data, at least in theory (plaintext password).

  PBKDF2 is a pretty easy function: it performs the HMAC as many times as specified by the ‘iterations’ parameter. ... While PBKDF2 is a hard job on a CPU, it’s a quite easy job for a GPU system.

  BCrypt is from 1999 and is GPU-ASIC resilient by design as it’s also a memory hardening function: it’s not just CPU intensive, but also RAM-intensive to execute a bcrypt hash.

  However times have changed and a sophisticated and maybe rich attacker will use big and powerful FPGA, and the contemporary models have now embedded RAM blocks, which greatly optimize this job. So while Bcrypt does a good job at making life difficult for an ASIC attacker, it does little against a FPGA one.

  Scrypt solves this since 2009 as it doesn’t just use exponential time, but also exponential memory.

  In this case, bcrypt has the best ones a cryptographic algorithm can desire:

  * it has been vetted by the entire crypto community as it’s now 15 years old
  * it has been out there in the field for almost 15 years and yet remains unbroken
  * it is also widely used, supported and implemented in efficient ways

  From a security perspective, I’d say that bcrypt is the best of the three.

  However, Scrypt is also 6 years old now, it won’t take that much until we can say it’s a proven secure algorithm.

The above article was written in 2015 and `Argon2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>`_ was the winner of the 2015 `Password Hashing Competition <https://password-hashing.net/>`_. For Argon2 information see the GitHub site `P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2 <https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2>`_, the IETF draft `The memory-hard Argon2 password hash and proof-of-work function draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-03 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/>`_, the competition write-up `Open Sesame The Password Hashing Competition and Argon2 <https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/104.pdf>`_, and finally the Argon2 write-up by the Argon2 authors `Argon2: the memory-hard function for password hashing and other applications <https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf>`_.

To hash passwords with ARGON2:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  sudo apt install argon2 -y  < /dev/null
  echo "somepassword" | argon2 "salt text" -e

Encrypt files with ``scrypt``:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1-

  sudo apt install scrypt -y  < /dev/null
  time (echo password | scrypt enc -P hashme.txt hashme.scrypt)
  time (echo password | scrypt dec -P hashme.scrypt hashme.txt2)
  diff hashme.txt hashme.txt2


OpenPGP
=======


GnuPG
-----

For a general overview see `GNU Privacy Guard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard>`_. Use the latest GnuPG (currently 2.2) to get the strongest encryption algorithms.

To configure GPG for best encryption, create :file:`$HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf`:

.. code-block:: text
  :emphasize-lines: 1-4,6,8-11,13-15

  personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES
  personal-digest-preferences SHA256 SHA512
  personal-compress-preferences Uncompressed
  default-preference-list SHA256 SHA512 AES256 AES Uncompressed
  
  cert-digest-algo SHA256
  
  s2k-cipher-algo AES256
  s2k-digest-algo SHA256
  s2k-mode 3
  s2k-count 65011712
  
  disable-cipher-algo 3DES
  weak-digest SHA1
  force-mdc

To install OpenGPG and show the version with supported algorithms:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3

  sudo apt install gnupg2 -y  < /dev/null
  ls -l /usr/bin/gpg{,2}
  gpg --version
  # Supported algorithms:
  # Pubkey: RSA, ELG, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA, EDDSA

Generating a GPG key
--------------------

Following `GPG Encryption Guide - Part 1 <http://www.tutonics.com/2012/11/gpg-encryption-guide-part-1.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,11,14,18,20,22,24-

  gpg --full-generate-key
  # enter = default key RSA and RSA
  # 4096 = keysize
  # 0 = key does not expire
  # y = correct
  # hacker = real name
  # hacker@bitbender.org = email address
  # enter = no comment
  # O = okay
  # passphrase = password for key
  gpg --list-public-keys
  gpg --list-public-keys hacker
  gpg --list-public-keys hacker@bitbender.org
  gpg --list-secret-keys
  gpg --list-secret-keys hacker
  gpg --list-secret-keys hacker@bitbender.org

  # Export public key for sharing
  ID=hacker
  gpg --armor --export hacker > $ID.asc
  cat $ID.asc
  # gpg --import $ID.asc

  # Move private key to another machine
  gpg --export-secret-keys $ID > ${ID}_private_key
  # gpg import ${ID}_private_key


Asymmetric GPG encryption (with signing)
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1,6-7,9


  TXT=encryptme.txt
  printf '1234567890%.0s' {0..99} > $TXT
  wc -c $TXT

  ID=hacker
  gpg --yes --armor --encrypt --sign -u $ID -r $ID \
      --output ${TXT}.asc $TXT
  cat ${TXT}.asc
  gpg2 --decrypt --output ${TXT}.orig ${TXT}.asc
  diff $TXT ${TXT}.orig


Symmetric GPG encryption
------------------------

Following `GPG Encryption Guide - Part 4 (Symmetric Encryption) <http://www.tutonics.com/2012/11/gpg-encryption-guide-part-4-symmetric.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 5-6,8-9

  TXT=encryptme.txt
  printf '1234567890%.0s' {0..99} > $TXT
  wc -c $TXT

  # Encrypt
  gpg --armor --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 -o ${TXT}.asc $TXT
  cat ${TXT}.asc
  # Decrypt
  gpg -o ${TXT}.orig -d ${TXT}.asc
  diff $TXT ${TXT}.orig
