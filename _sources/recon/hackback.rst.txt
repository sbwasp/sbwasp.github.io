`HackBack!`_
************

A hacker named Phineas Fisher claimed responsibility for the 2015 hack of the `Hacking Team <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team>`_ and the 2014 hack on `Gamma Group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Group>`_. The alleged perpetrator published a "DIY Guide" `HackBack! v1`_ followed by an updated `HackBack!`_. Well worth reading.
