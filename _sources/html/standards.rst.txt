W3C & WHATWG
============

There are 2 HTML standards groups: World Wide Web Consortium (`W3C`_) and Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (`WHATWG`_). W3C produces snapshot standards which trail the WHATWG living standard. See `HTML/W3C-WHATWG-Differences <http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/W3C-WHATWG-Differences>`_.


From `Wikipedia WHATWG <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG>`_, in 2004:

  The WHATWG was formed in response to the slow development of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web standards and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies.

Around 2007 the W3C adopted the WHATWG specification as HTML5. But in 2012, from the post `[whatwg] Administrivia: Update on the relationship between the WHATWG HTML living standard and the W3C HTML5 specification <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Jul/0119.html>`_:

  More recently, the goals of the W3C and the WHATWG on the HTML front have diverged a bit as well. The WHATWG effort is focused on developing the canonical description of HTML and related technologies, meaning fixing bugs as we find them, adding new features as they become necessary and viable, and generally tracking implementations. The W3C effort, meanwhile, is now focused on creating a snapshot developed according to the venerable W3C process. This led to the chairs of the W3C HTML working group and myself deciding to split the work into two, with a different person responsible for editing the W3C HTML5, canvas, and microdata specifications than is editing the WHATWG specification (me).

  ... we are now independent of the W3C HTML Working Group again, while still maintaining a working relationship with the W3C.
