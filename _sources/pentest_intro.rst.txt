South Bay WASP Meetup
#####################

Welcome to the `South Bay WASP Meetup`_ (the Manhattan Beach branch of the `Penetration Testing Meetup Groups`_). We meet every Saturday from 1 - 3+ PM at `Bobaloca Manhattan Beach`_ (see the `Bobaloca Manhattan Beach map`_).

These informal notes will help you get started, review some of the topics we've covered, and we post upcoming study material when possible. If you have questions or comments about this site, please email "pentest -hyphen- meetup at bitbender dot org". You can download a current `PDF version of these notes </WebAppSecurityPentesters.pdf>`_ or an `epub version of these notes </WebAppSecurityPentesters.epub>`_.

****************************
What You Need to Participate
****************************

You'll want to run `Kali Linux`_ on a laptop with wireless access. See `Installing Kali Linux <http://docs.kali.org/category/installation>`_ for options, including `Kali Linux Hard Disk Install <http://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install>`_ and `Kali Linux Live USB Install <http://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-live-usb-install>`_. Alternatively, run Kali as a virtual machine on your laptop using the virtualization software of your choice: `VMware Player`_ (see `VMware Tools in a Kali Guest <http://docs.kali.org/general-use/install-vmware-tools-kali-guest>`_) and `VirtualBox`_ (see `Kali Linux Virtual Box Guest <http://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-virtual-box-guest>`_) are popular, though Linux users may prefer `libvirt`_/`KVM`_. See `Kali Linux Documentation`_ for more installation information.

If you are using a desktop (outside the meetup) or want a second USB-based wireless card for your laptop, there are a number of good USB-based wireless cards but you should do research to insure that the card is compatible with Kali. The message is to make sure the wireless card is supported by Kali before your purchase.
