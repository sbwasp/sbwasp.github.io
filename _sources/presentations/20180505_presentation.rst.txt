#. `Project Sonar: An Underrated Source of Internet-wide Data <https://0xpatrik.com/project-sonar-guide/>`_ - "The `Internet-Wide Scans Data Repository (scans.io) <https://scans.io/>`_ was created alongside `Censys <https://censys.io/>`_. The purpose of this repository is to provide raw datasets that were gathered during periodic Internet-wide scans by Censys." See `rapid7/sonar <https://github.com/rapid7/sonar/wiki>`_.

Tech
^^^^

#. `Exclusive: Spectre-NG - Multiple new Intel CPU flaws revealed, several serious <https://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Exclusive-Spectre-NG-Multiple-new-Intel-CPU-flaws-revealed-several-serious-4040648.html>`_

   A total of eight new security flaws in Intel CPUs have already been reported to the manufacturer by several teams of researchers. For now, details on the flaws are being kept secret. All eight are essentially caused by the same design problem – you could say that they are Spectre Next Generation.

   Knowing that Google Project Zero discovered one of the Spectre-NG flaws gives us an idea of when to expect the first patch. Googles elite hackers are scrupulous about observing the 90 day deadline that is meant to give companies time to address flaws after they have been notified – but they have no qualms about going public when the deadline ends, even if a patch has yet to be released. Time will run out on May 7 – the day before the next Windows patch day.

Study this week
===============


Container examples
------------------


From the web
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. `Burp Collaborator Server docker container with LetsEncrypt certificate <https://github.com/integrity-sa/burpcollaborator-docker>`_ - "This repository includes a set of scripts to install a Burp Collaborator Server in a docker environment, using a LetsEncrypt wildcard certificate. The objective is to simplify as much as possible the process of setting up and maintaining the server."

#. `My PoC walk through for CVE-2018–6789 <https://medium.com/@straightblast426/my-poc-walk-through-for-cve-2018-6789-2e402e4ff588>`_ - 


Getting Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing ``docker`` in Linux
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For Debian/Kali follow `Get Docker CE for Debian <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/>`_ and for Ubuntu follow `Get Docker CE for Ubuntu <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>`_. Kali will fail the ``add-apt-repository`` so manually add *deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable*. Ubuntu bionic (18.04) not yet supported so temporarity use Ubuntu artful (17.10) repo.

From `Post-installation steps for Linux <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/>`_ make sure to at least ``sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`` to insure your account can run ``docker`` without ``sudo``.


CoreOS in Linode
""""""""""""""""

See `linode Guides & Tutorial >> Applications >> Containers <https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/>`_ for container articles, with `Use CoreOS Container Linux on Linode <https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/use-coreos-container-linux-on-linode/>`_ for specific differences deploying CoreOS on Linode:

* User is **core** and not **root**

* Does not use grub2 to boot, instead using "Direct Disk"

* Not compatible with Linode kernels

* swap file cannot be present in :file:`/etc/fstab`

* `The CoreOS Update Philosophy <https://coreos.com/why/#updates>`_

  ... automates software updates to ensure better security and reliability of machines and containers running in large-scale clusters. Operating system updates and security patches are regularly pushed to CoreOS Container Linux machines without requiring intervention by administrators. When applications are distributed, these automatic updates dramatically improve security without causing service downtime.

* `Reboot strategies on updates <https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/update-strategies.html>`_ are one of

  .. list-table:: Reboot strategies on update
     :widths: 30 30
     :header-rows: 1

     *
       - STRATEGY
       - DESCRIPTION
     *
       - ``etcd-lock``
       - Reboot after first taking a distributed lock in etcd
     *
       - ``reboot``
       - Reboot immediately after an update is applied
     *
       - ``off``
       - Do not reboot after updates are applied


A simple ubuntu shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start with `Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_ then `Get Started, Part 2: Containers <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/>`_ for a simple start. After that try:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  docker --version
  docker version
  docker info

  docker run hello-world

  docker run -it ubuntu bash
  # In the bash shell:
  cat /etc/os-release  # container OS ubuntu bionic
  uname -a  # kernel of docker host
  hostname  # = docker container id
  ps -ef  # running only bash + ps
  cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal  # same memory as docker host
  ls -a /dev  # many missing devices including disks and network
  ls /boot  # empty
  # missing commands
  lsb_release -cs  # no lsb_release command
  ip link show  # no ip command
  ss -tnlp  # no ss command
  systemctl  # no systemctl command
  cat /etc/fstab  # UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM
  # modify the filesystem
  echo hello > /hello
  exit

  # To run the same container and see the modifications
  # "docker run -it ubuntu bash" would start a new container
  docker start -ai $(docker ps -lq)
  ls -al /
  exit

  # To persist the changes into an image
  docker commit $(docker ps -lq) my_new_image
  docker images
  docker run -it my_new_image bash
  ls -al /
  exit

  # Clean up
  docker stop $(docker ps -aq)  # stop all running containters
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)  # remove all containers
  # docker rmi $(docker images -q)
  docker image rm -f my_new_image


Docker for Penetration Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Docker for Penetration Testing <https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest#docker-for-penetration-testing>`_ (part of `Awesome Penetration Testing <https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest>`_) lists a number of challenges. In the past we've shown :ref:`The OWASP Juice Shop docker setup <juice_shop_docker_setup>` to run `OWASP Juice Shop Project <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project>`_. You can search for more: `Docker for Hackers? A pen tester’s guide <https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/docker-for-hackers-a-pen-testers-guide/>`_ and `Want a Docker Hacking Challenge? Try This Vulnerable VM <https://thenewstack.io/want-docker-hacking-challenge-try-vulnerable-vm/>`_ for starters.
