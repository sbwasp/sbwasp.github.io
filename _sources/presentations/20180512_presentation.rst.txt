Life in the terminal
--------------------


TAAG
^^^^

Use `TAAG <http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20>`_ to convert text to ASCII art. For example::
  
                        ____  ______        ___    ____  ____
                       / ___|| __ ) \      / / \  / ___||  _ \                      
		       \___ \|  _ \\ \ /\ / / _ \ \___ \| |_) |                     
			___) | |_) |\ V  V / ___ \ ___) |  __/                      
		       |____/|____/  \_/\_/_/   \_\____/|_|                         

   _ _  __        _         _   _            _                      _             _

asciinema
^^^^^^^^^

`asciinema <https://asciinema.org/>`_ is a tool to record and play terminal sessions. See `asciinema Docs <https://asciinema.org/docs/getting-started>`_.

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  pip install -U asciinema

  # record a session with at most 2.5 seconds idle time
  asciinema rec -i 2.5 curl.cast
  curl --tlsv1.3 --head https://sbwasp.github.io/
  curl --tlsv1.2 --head https://sbwasp.github.io/
  exit
  asciinema play curl.cast


Containers
----------


Twelve factor apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get an idea of the types of apps designed for containers see `The Twelve-Factor App <https://12factor.net/>`_, `Wikipedia Twelve-Factor App methodology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology>`_, and `The Twelve-Factor App (epub) <https://12factor.net/12factor.epub>`_.


Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^

See `Kubernetes tutorials <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/>`_ starting with `Kubernetes Basics <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/>`_. The tutorial uses `KataKoda <https://www.katacoda.com/>`_. Also see `Kubernetes Design and Architecture <https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/architecture.md>`_.

See `Running Kubernetes Locally via Minikube <https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/>`_: "Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day."

`etcd <https://github.com/coreos/etcd>`_ is the primary storage mechanism for K8s:

  etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

  * Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
  * Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
  * Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
  * Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

  etcd is written in Go and uses the `Raft <https://raft.github.io/>`_ consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

For a more complex introduction that requires a Google Cloud Platform account, see `Google Kubernetes Engine codelab <https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-gke-workshop-v2/index.html>`_.

For AWS see `Getting Started with Amazon Elastic Container Service <https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/getting-started/>`_ and the `Tutorial: Creating a Cluster with a Fargate Task Using the ECS CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI_tutorial_fargate.html>`_ or `Getting Started with Amazon ECS using Fargate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_GetStarted.html>`_.
