#. `Internal documents show how Amazon scrambled to fix Prime Day glitches <https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/amazon-internal-documents-what-caused-prime-day-crash-company-scramble.html>`_

   Caesar says the root cause of the problem may have to do with a failure in Amazon’s auto-scaling feature, which automatically detects traffic fluctuations and adjusts server capacity accordingly. The fact that Amazon cut off international traffic first, rather than increase the number of servers immediately, and added server power manually instead of automatically, is an indication of a breakdown in auto-scaling, a critical component when dealing with unexpected traffic spikes, he said.

   “If their auto-scaling was working, things would have scaled automatically and they wouldn't have had this level of outage,” Caesar said. “There was probably an implementation or configuration error in their automatic scaling systems.”

   Carl Kesselman, a computer science professor at USC, said Amazon’s response to the outage was rather impressive because in many cases the site would have crashed entirely under those circumstances.

   “Amazon is operating at a scale we haven’t operated before,” he said. “It’s not clear there’s a bad guy or an obvious screw-up. It’s just we’re in uncharted territory, and it’s amazing it didn’t just fall over.”

#. `Google: Security Keys Neutralized Employee Phishing <https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutered-employee-phishing/>`_

   Google has not had any of its 85,000+ employees successfully phished on their work-related accounts since early 2017, when it began requiring all employees to use physical Security Keys in place of passwords and one-time codes, the company told KrebsOnSecurity.

   Unfortunately, Australia has taken actions that indicate the nation is willing to undermine human rights as it adapts to the challenges of the digital era. It may be that in fact, Australia has expanded its surveillance laws and practices more since 9/11 than any other nation.

   "Attackers recreated the [first company's] infrastructure on a replica server that the attackers owned and controlled. They copied and hosted all MSI files, including font packages, all clean and digitally signed, in the replica server," Microsoft's security researchers said.

   "The attackers decompiled and modified one MSI file, an Asian fonts pack, to add the malicious payload with the coin mining code," they added.

   "Using an unspecified weakness (which does not appear to be MITM or DNS hijack), the attackers were able to influence the download parameters used by the [PDF editor] app. The parameters included a new download link that pointed to the attacker server," Microsoft said.

   Users who downloaded and ran the PDF editor app would unknowingly install the font packages, including the malicious one, from the hackers' cloned server.

   Because the PDF editor app was installed under SYSTEM privileges, the malicious coinminer code hidden inside would receive full access to a user's system.

   The malicious miner would create its own process named xbox-service.exe under which it would mine for cryptocurrencies using victims' computers.

   Microsoft said Windows Defender ATP detected mining-specific behavior from this process. Investigators then tracked down the origin of this process to the PDF editor app installer and the MSI font packages.
