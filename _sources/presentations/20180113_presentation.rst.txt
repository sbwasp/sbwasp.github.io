#. `Intel AMT Security Issue Lets Attackers Bypass Login Credentials in Corporate Laptops <https://press.f-secure.com/2018/01/12/intel-amt-security-issue-lets-attackers-bypass-login-credentials-in-corporate-laptops/>`_ and `Researcher finds another security flaw in Intel management firmware <https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/researcher-finds-another-security-flaw-in-intel-management-firmware/>`_

   Notebook and desktop PCs with Intel AMT can be compromised in moments by someone with physical access to the computer—even bypassing BIOS passwords, Trusted Platform Module personal identification numbers, and Bitlocker disk encryption passwords—by rebooting the computer, entering its BIOS boot menu, and selecting configuration for Intel’s Management Engine BIOS Extension (MEBx). If MEBx hasn't been configured by the user or by their organization's IT department, the attacker can log into the configuration settings using Intel's default password of "admin.” The attacker can then change the password, enable remote access, and set the firmware to not give the computer's user an "opt-in" message at boot time. "Now the attacker can gain access to the system remotely," F-Secure's release noted, "as long as they’re able to insert themselves onto the same network segment with the victim (enabling wireless access requires a few extra steps)."

#. `Visualizing Meltdown on AWS <https://blog.appoptics.com/visualizing-meltdown-aws/>`_

   As of 10:00 UTC this morning we are noticing a step reduction in CPU usage across our instances. It is unclear if there are additional patches being rolled out, but CPU levels appear to be returning to pre-HVM patch levels.


Responses to Meltdown and Spectre
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. `How Tier 2 cloud vendors banded together to cope with Spectre and Meltdown <https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/06/how-tier-2-cloud-vendors-banded-together-to-cope-with-spectre-and-meltdown/>`_

#. `Re: Avoid speculative indirect calls in kernel <https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/3/797>`_ - Linus Torvalds ... "I think somebody inside of Intel needs to really take a long hard look at their CPU's, and actually admit that they have issues instead of writing PR blurbs that say that everything works as designed."

Patches and patch problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. `Important information about Microsoft Meltdown CPU security fixes, antivirus vendors and you <https://doublepulsar.com/important-information-about-microsoft-meltdown-cpu-security-fixes-antivirus-vendors-and-you-a852ba0292ec>`_

   "Customers will not receive the January 2018 security updates (or any subsequent security updates) and will not be protected from security vulnerabilities unless their antivirus software vendor sets the following registry key"

   There is also another element here - on Windows Server, the Meltdown and Spectre patches don't actually do a thing.

   To enable the fix ... So yes, unless you actually add those keys the patches don't actually enable the CPU mitigations.
