Study this week
===============


``nmap`` nuances
----------------

The definitive guide to ``nmap`` is `Chapter 15. Nmap Reference Guide <https://nmap.org/book/man.html>`_. Would-be pentesters should first learn `Port Scanning Basics <https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html>`_ and `Port Scanning Techniques <https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html>`_. More advanced users should consult `Timing and Performance <https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html>`_, `Firewall/IDS Evasion and Spoofing <https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html>`_, `http-waf-detect <https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-detect.html>`_, and `Output <https://nmap.org/book/man-output.html>`_.

Not covered above is using ``xsltproc`` to process ``nmap`` XML output into report-ready HTML:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 4

  sudo nmap -sn -PE -oA nmap_sn 192.168.1.0/24
  sudo chown $USER.$USER nmap_sn.*
  grep Up nmap_sn.gnmap | cut -d" " -f2 > targets.txt
  xsltproc nmap_sn.xml -o nmap_sn.html


Cryptography
------------

Please see :ref:`crypto` for a continuation of our cryptography discussion.
