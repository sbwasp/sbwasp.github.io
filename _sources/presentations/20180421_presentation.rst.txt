#. `A.I. Researchers Are Making More Than $1 Million, Even at a Nonprofit <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-salaries-openai.html>`_

#. `The Android ecosystem contains a hidden patch gap <https://srlabs.de/bites/android_patch_gap/>`_ - "large study of Android phones finds that most Android vendors regularly forget to include some patches, leaving parts of the ecosystem exposed to the underlying risks." But "a few missing patches are usually not enough for a hacker to remotely compromise an Android device. Instead, multiple bugs need to be chained together for a successful hack."

   Presentation at `Mind the Gap - Uncovering the Android patch gap through binary-only patch analysis <https://srlabs.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SRLabs-Mind_the_gap-Android_Patch_Gap-HITB_2018.pdf>`_.

   `Android’s trust problem isn’t getting better <https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17233122/android-software-patch-trust-problem>`_

     The gap between Android and its nemesis, Apple’s iOS, has always boiled down to trust. Unlike Google, Apple doesn’t make its money by tracking the behavior of its users, and unlike the vast and varied Android ecosystem, there are only ever a couple of iPhone models, each of which is updated with regularity and over a long period of time. Owning an iPhone, you can be confident that you’re among Apple’s priority users (even if Apple faces its own cohort of critics accusing it of planned obsolescence), whereas with an Android device, as evidenced today, you can’t even be sure that the security bulletins and updates you’re getting are truthful.

     Android One guarantees OS updates for at least two years and security updates for at least three years.

   Note - non-Google phones listed as only 18 months support.

   `Some Android phone manufacturers are lying to users about missed security updates <https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17228510/android-phone-manufacturers-missed-security-updates-lie>`_ - "Android phones are infamously slow to get updates — as of `Google’s last update in February <https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16975714/android-nougat-google-oreo-marshmallow-most-used-devices-developer-update-numbers>`_, only 1.1 percent of Android users have access to the latest version of the software ...".

#. `Intel, Microsoft to use GPU to scan memory for malware <https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/intel-microsoft-to-use-gpu-to-scan-memory-for-malware/>`_ - TDT (Threat Detection Technology) uses GPU to find malware via "Advance Memory Scanning" in Windows ATP (Advanced Threat Protection); APT (Advanced Platform Telemetry) uses "the processor's integrated performance counters to spot unusual processor activity" by "creating data that can be fed into some cloud systems and used to make inferences about system health".
