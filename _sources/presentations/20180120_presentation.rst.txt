     Access to services is granted based on what we know about you and your device.

     All access to services must be authenticated, authorized and encrypted.

CPU Speculative Execution Attacks: Meltdown and Spectre
-------------------------------------------------------


Good summaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. `How a 22-Year-Old Discovered the Worst Chip Flaws in History <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/how-a-22-year-old-discovered-the-worst-chip-flaws-in-history>`_

   Other researchers who found the same security holes months after Horn are amazed he worked alone. "We were several teams, and we had clues where to start. He was working from scratch," said Daniel Gruss, part of a team at Graz University of Technology in Austria that later uncovered what are now known as Meltdown and Spectre.

   Mario Heiderich, founder of Berlin-based cybersecurity consultancy Cure53, first noticed Horn in mid-2014. Not yet 20, Horn had posted intriguing tweets on a way to bypass a key security feature designed to prevent malicious code from infecting a user’s computer. Cure53 had been working on similar methods, so Heiderich shot Horn a message, and before long they were discussing whether Horn would like to join Cure53’s small team.

   Before long, Cure53’s penetration testers were talking about what they called "the Jann effect" -- the young hacker consistently came up with extremely creative attacks. Meltdown and Spectre are just two examples of Horn’s brilliance, according to Heiderich. "He’s not a one-hit wonder. This is what he does."

   After two years at Cure53 and completing his undergraduate program, Horn was recruited by Google to work on Project Zero.

   What this means is that if you're lucky enough to have a system that is still being supported with firmware updates from its manufacturer—because let's be honest: good luck getting any firmware updates for any consumer PC or motherboard that's more than about 18 months old—you probably shouldn't install the firmware anyway. Unless, that is, you're in a high risk category such as a cloud host or VPS provider, in which case you'll just have to install it anyway, because the consequences of not upgrading are probably worse than the consequences of upgrading.
