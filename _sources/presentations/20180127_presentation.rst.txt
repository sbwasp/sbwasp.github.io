   Google’s approach involves comprehensive inventory management, one that keeps track of who owns which machine in the network.

   The network itself is unprivileged. For identity management, the company uses security keys, which are much harder to forge than passwords and are tied to the individual users themselves. Each work device has a certificate issued by Google. Encryption across the network is done through TLS (transport layer security), which is terminated at the access proxy.

   All the corporate resources are behind this uber-reverse proxy. Based on a decision provided by its “trust engine,” the proxy makes the decision of whether or not to provide access to the desired application. If permissions are in place, according to the tiered trust model, it forwards the requests to the application, along with the security credentials. The applications themselves are routinely checked for breaches by vulnerability scanners.

   Amazingly, Google was able to shift all of its employees, including remotes ones, over to this new model, with minimal disruption, Saltonstall said.

   ... 58 percent of respondents cite existing culture and lack of skills as hurdles to being able to embed security within processes.

   ... only 24 percent strongly agree that their organization's culture and practices support collaboration across development, operations and security. On top of cultural limitations, less than a quarter of respondents strongly agree that senior management understands the importance of not sacrificing security for time-to-market success.

   The top 34 percent of respondents are organizations that have been able to fully integrate security into the software development lifecycle, the report calls these 'Software Security Masters'.

   The whole IBRS_ALL feature to me very clearly says "Intel is not serious about this, we'll have a ugly hack that will be so expensive that we don't want to enable it by default, because that would look bad in benchmarks".

   So somebody isn't telling the truth here. Somebody is pushing complete garbage for unclear reasons. Sorry for having to point that out.

   As it is, the patches  are COMPLETE AND UTTER GARBAGE.

   They do literally insane things. They do things that do not make sense. That makes all your arguments questionable and suspicious. The patches do things that are not sane.

   WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON?

   And that's actually ignoring the much _worse_ issue, namely that the whole hardware interface is literally mis-designed by morons.
