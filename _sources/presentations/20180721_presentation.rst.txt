Study this week
===============


HTTP(S) vs HTML
---------------

See :ref:`HTML_standards` and :ref:`HTTP_vs_HTML`.


AWS VPC
-------


AWS Training and Certification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Welcome to AWS Training and Certification`_ and `Prepare for AWS Certification`_. From `AWS Certification Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)`_ :menuselection:`Schedule your exam --> Q: How much does an AWS Certification exam cost?`:

  The Cloud Practitioner exam is 100 USD. Associate-level exams are 150 USD. Professional-level and Specialty exams are 300 USD. Recertification exams are 75 USD.

And from :menuselection:`About AWS Certification --> Q: How long will my certification be valid?`:

  You will be required to update your certification (or “recertify”) every two years. View the `AWS Certification Recertification page <https://aws.amazon.com/certification/recertification/?src=certification-faqs>`_ for more details.


VPC Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `AWS Documentation`_ for the complete documentation collection and `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Documentation`_ for VPC documentation.


EC2-Classic vs EC2-VPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Supported Platforms`_ allows instances to be launched into:

* EC2-Classic - original EC2 release where instances for all cusomters run in a single, flat network.

* EC2-VPC - instances run in a VPC (virutal private cloud) logically isolated to your AWS account.

See `Differences Between EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC`_.

To see if your AWS account supports only VPC:

.. code-block:: bash

  aws ec2 describe-account-attributes --attribute-names supported-platforms


VPCs and Subnets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - What Is Amazon VPC?`_ for an introduction. Each VPC must have at least 1 IPv4 CIDR block and an optional IPv6 /56 block. The subnets within the VPC are allocated non-overlapping CIDR blocks from within the VPC CIDR blocks, with IPv6 having /64 subnets. A VPC is contained in a region and each subnet is within one availability zone. Each AWS account has a default VPC with a default subnet in each AZ and an Internet gateway. EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC unless specified otherwise.

See `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - VPCs and Subnets`_ for a discussion of these terms: route table; VPGW (VPN connection with Virtual private gateway and customer gateway endpoints); IGW (Internet Gateway); NAT; EIGW (IPv6 egress gateway); AWS PrivateLink; security group; network ACL; flow log. See `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Egress-Only Internet Gateways`_ for more information on EIGW.

The primary CIDR for a VPC has the first 4 and last address reserved (+0 = subnet, +1 = router, +2 = DNS, +3 = reserved for future use, -0 = reserved), which are also reserved for each subnet.


Subnet security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Security`_ for a more detailed discussion of security groups, network ACLs, and Flow logs. More details are available at `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Security Groups for Your VPC`_, `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Network ACLs`_, `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - VPC Flow Logs`_.











VPC Peering
^^^^^^^^^^^

VPC peering allows network traffic to travel between VPCs of the same or different AWS account VPCs via private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, even between different regions. Start with `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - What is VPC Peering?`_ and `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - VPC Peering Basics`_. The major restrictions are detailed in `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Unsupported VPC Peering Configurations`_:

* No overlapping CIDR blocks.

* No IPv6 for inter-region VPC peering connection.

* VPC peering is not transitive, so anything connected to a VPC is not accessible to its peer:

  * A transivitve (remote) VPC requires direct peering.

  * VPN

  * Internet gateway

  * NAT device

  * AWS service VPC endpoint

For assistance with customer gateway VPN setup see `Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - Network Administrator Guide`_.
