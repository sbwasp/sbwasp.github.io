Google's Cloud Load Balancer could handle their load and more plus IPv6 support. GKE was more complex than desired.

      Examining static properties of suspicious files is a good starting point for malware analysis. This effort allows you to perform an initial assessment of the file without even infecting a lab system or studying its code. Let's take a look at several free Windows tools that are useful for extracting such meta data from potentially-malicious executables.

   In this blog post I will discuss the steps to use PowerShell, Invoke-CradleCrafter and Microsoft’s Certutil.exe to craft a payload and one-liner that can be used to evade the latest version of Windows Defender (as of this writing), as well as tips for not getting caught by Intrusion Detection Systems and behavior analysis.

   QRadar has a built-in application to perform forensic analysis on certain files. This is disabled in the free Community Edition, but the code is still there, and part of it still works. This application has two components, one servlet running in Java, and the main web application running PHP. This exploit chain abuses both components of the forensics application to bypass authentication and write a file to disk, and then it abuses a cron job to escalate privileges to root.

Inexpensive cloud VMs
---------------------

Recently my GCE small VM got a suggestion to upgrade due to "overuse": I had been rebuilding this website a bit too often on this shared-CPU VM. So we looked at using credits on Linode cheaply to create as-needed VMs to author this site. Persistent block storage of 10GB ($0.10/GB/month) is used to store persistent data. There are 2 options to quickly creating an as-needed VM.

First a StackScript can be used to create a new VM, doing a complete installation of all needed packages upon start. Just select the option to create a VM using a StackScript. Here goes a StackScript for Ubuntu 18.04:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  #*************************
  # As root
  #*************************

  # Add block storage to /etc/fstab
  DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_DATA
  NAME=DATA
  cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
  echo "/dev/mapper/$NAME /mnt/disks/$NAME ext4 discard,defaults,nofail 0 0" | tee -a /etc/fstab

  # Apps install
  apt install emacs-nox graphviz make -y  < /dev/null
  apt install python3-venv -y  < /dev/null
  apt install cryptsetup-bin -y  < /dev/null
  snap install google-cloud-sdk --classic
  apt install unattended-upgrades -y  < /dev/null

  apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
  apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
  add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) edge"
  apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce -y

  # sudo NOPASSWD
  sed -i '/^%sudo/s/ ALL$/ NOPASSWD:ALL/' /etc/sudoers

  # Force ssh keys
  SSHD=/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' $SSHD
  sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' $SSHD
  sed -i 's/^#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' $SSHD

  # Force UTF-8
  update-locale LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

  # SSH for root (used by normal user)
  mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
  chmod 700 $HOME/.ssh
  cat > $HOME/.ssh/config <<'EOF'
  Host bitbucket.org
      HostName bitbucket.org
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_bb
      IdentitiesOnly yes
  Host github.com
      HostName github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_github
      IdentitiesOnly yes
  Host compute
      User jim.maki
      HostName compute.bitbender.org
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_gce
      IdentitiesOnly yes
  EOF
  cat > $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys <<'EOF'
  # put your public SSH key here
  EOF

  # Add oresama
  U=oresama
  useradd -c "$U" -G sudo -m -s /bin/bash -U $U
  sed -i 's/#umask 022/umask 027/' /home/$U/.profile

  mkdir -p /home/$U/.ssh
  chmod 700 /home/$U/.ssh
  chown ${U}.${U} /home/$U/.ssh
  cp $HOME/.ssh/{authorized_keys,config} /home/$U/.ssh/
  chmod 600 /home/$U/.ssh/authorized_keys
  chown ${U}.${U} /home/$U/.ssh/*

  MP=/mnt/disks/$NAME
  mkdir -p $MP
  chgrp $U /mnt/disks

  #*************************
  # As normal user
  #*************************

  su - $U <<'EOSU'
  mkdir -p ~/py3
  python3 -m venv ~/py3
  source ~/py3/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install --upgrade sphinx graphviz sphinx_rtd_theme
  pip install --upgrade awscli

  echo 'export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=$(which python2)' >> ~/.profile
  echo 'source ~/py3/bin/activate' >> ~/.profile

  # for git commits
  YOUR_EMAIL='bitbender@bitbender.org'
  YOUR_NAME="bitbender"
  git config --global user.email $YOUR_EMAIL
  git config --global user.name "$YOUR_NAME"

  sudo apt update  < /dev/null
  sudo apt full-upgrade -y  < /dev/null
  sudo apt autoremove -y  < /dev/null

  echo done > done
  EOSU

  # bug out
  sudo init 6

Then, when logging into the VM for the first time, get GCP credentials and mount persistent disk.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
  # reboot if needed

  gcloud auth login
  # Login using web browser
  gcloud config set project <Google project>

  # Assume device manually connected to this VM
  DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_DATA
  NAME=DATA
  sudo cryptsetup open $DEVICE $NAME
  # Enter password
  MP=/mnt/disks/$NAME
  sudo mount $MP

  ( cd /mnt/disks/DATA/backup/config
  cp -r .aws .emacs .gsutil .ssh .tmux .tmux.conf .vimrc ~/ )

  # ...

  # When done
  sudo umount /mnt/disks/$NAME
  sudo cryptsetup close $NAME

The other way is to create an image from the host created above *before* the firt-time login customization. Then that image can be used to create a Linode VM, and you can directly proceed to steps for logging in the first time. This has the advantage of avoiding the StackScript execution time.

The cost for all this is $1/month for block storage, plus $0.0075/hour for VM runtime. There is the extra effort for logging into the VM for the first time. But you retain the flexibility to use a larger VM as required for that session.

Note that encrypted block storage was used so as to avoid permanently storing secrets on an unencrypted disk image.
