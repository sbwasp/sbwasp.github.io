#. `Public Domain: How Configuration Information For the World's Largest Domain Name Registrar Was Exposed Online <https://www.upguard.com/breaches/public-domain-how-configuration-information-for-the-worlds-largest-domain-name-registrar-was-exposed-online>`_

   The UpGuard Cyber Risk Team has discovered and secured a data exposure of documents appearing to describe GoDaddy infrastructure running in the Amazon AWS cloud, preventing any future exploitation of this information. The documents were left exposed in a publicly accessible Amazon S3 bucket ...

   We have outlined some examples of how S3 permissions can be misconfigured to exposed data, but put simply, there are two groups that must be used with extreme care: ... **All Users (Everyone)**  ... **Authenticated Users (All AWS Users)**

     Fake news, copyright violation, media forensics, privacy and security are emerging challenges for digital media. JPEG has determined that blockchain technology has great potential as a technology component to address these challenges in transparent and trustable media transactions.

#. `Foreshadow -  Breaking the Virtual Memory Abstraction with Transient Out-of-Order Execution <https://foreshadowattack.eu/>`_, `L1 Terminal Fault / CVE-2018-3615 , CVE-2018-3620,CVE-2018-3646 / INTEL-SA-00161 <https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1-terminal-fault>`_, and `Intel’s SGX blown wide open by, you guessed it, a speculative execution attack <https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/intels-sgx-blown-wide-open-by-you-guessed-it-a-speculative-execution-attack/>`_

   Giorgi Maisuradze and Prof. Dr. Christian Rossow discovered that the ret2spec (return-to-speculation) vulnerability again enables attackers to read data without authorization. At least all Intel processors of the past ten years are affected by the vulnerabilities. Similar attack mechanisms could probably also be derived for ARM and AMD processors.

   This fifth and hitherto unknown vulnerability in CPUs will be presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) in Toronto (Canada) in October.
