That system is intended to block domains associated with botnets, phishing attacks, and other malicious Internet hosts—primarily targeted at organizations that don’t run their own DNS blacklisting and whitelisting services. Called Quad9 (after the 9.9.9.9 Internet Protocol address the service has obtained), the service works like any other public DNS server (such as Google’s), except that it won’t return name resolutions for sites that are identified via threat feeds the service aggregates daily.</div></blockquote>

<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eweek.com/security/schneier-it-s-time-to-regulate-iot-to-improve-cyber-security">Schneier: It’s Time to Regulate IoT to Improve Cyber-Security</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The time has come for the U.S. government and other governments around the world, to start regulating Internet of Things (IoT) security, according to Bruce Schneier, CTO of IBM’s Resilient Systems.</p>
<p>“We’re building a robot the size of the world and most people don’t even realize it,” Schneier said.</p>
<p>What that means is that internet security is now becoming ‘everything’ security, according to Schneier.</p>
<p>“Availability and integrity threats are important as real risks to life and property now,” Schneier said.</p>
<p>In Schneier’s view, the challenge of cyber-security cannot be effectively solved by industry alone, instead he advocated for government involvement to help regulate technology security. As internet connected devices move into regulated industries, Schneier expects that computer software which has largely been regulation-free, will need to change. There are also historical precedents for new technology usage leading to new government agencies and regulations. For example, the emergence of cars, airplanes, radio and television have all led to government agencies and regulation.</p>

<p>From <a class="reference external" href="https://theoutline.com/post/2490/why-is-this-company-tracking-where-you-are-on-thanksgiving">Why is this company tracking where you are on Thanksgiving?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This morning, a few publications ran with a holiday-themed data study about how families that voted for opposite parties <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/15/politics-really-is-ruining-thanksgiving-according-to-data-from-10-million-cellphones/?utm_term=.f8d124e204c6">spent less time together on Thanksgiving</a>, especially in areas that saw heavy political advertising. It’s an interesting finding about how partisan the country is becoming, and admirably, the study’s authors tried to get data that would be more accurate than self-reporting through surveys. To do this, they tapped a company called SafeGraph that provided them with 17 trillion location markers for 10 million smartphones.</p>
<p>The data wasn’t just staggering in sheer quantity. It also appears to be extremely granular. Researchers “used this data to identify individuals’ home locations, which they defined as the places people were most often located between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m.,” wrote The Washington Post.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="http://www.citilabs.com/citilabs_blog/citilabs-partners-location-data-company-safegraph-enhance-streetlytics-mobility-analytics-platform/">multiple</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.citilabs.com/citilabs_blog/citilabs-partners-location-data-company-safegraph-enhance-streetlytics-mobility-analytics-platform/">press releases</a> from SafeGraph’s partners, the company’s location data is referred to as “anonymized,” but in this case they seem to be interpreting the concept of anonymity quite liberally given the specificity of the data.</p>
<p>SafeGraph gets location data from “<a class="reference external" href="https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/sharable_fulldraft.pdf">from numerous smartphone apps</a>,” according to the researchers. According to SafeGraph’s privacy policy: “We obtain information from trusted third-party data partners such as mobile application developers, through APIs and other delivery methods. The data collection and use is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by SafeGraph.” In other words, SafeGraph is partnering with apps — they could be weather apps, games, wallpapers, anything — and leaving the disclosure up to the app maker. The app makers may have some tiny print that says “we reserve the right to share your location data with third parties,” or they may not have a disclosure at all — it’s not SafeGraph’s problem. “The information we collect includes data regarding a device’s precise geographic location, as well as other mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFAs and Google Android IDs, and <strong>other information about users and their devices</strong>,” (emphasis ours) the privacy policy continues.</p>

<h4>11.16.1.5.2. Supercookies &amp; zombie cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#supercookies-zombie-cookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Supercookie">Wikipedia - HTTP cookie - Supercookie</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The term “supercookie” is sometimes used for tracking technologies that do not rely on HTTP cookies. Two such “supercookie” mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites in August 2011: cookie syncing that respawned MUID (machine unique identifier) cookies, and ETag cookies. Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code.</div></blockquote>
<p>From <a class="reference external" href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2011/08/tracking-trackers-microsoft-advertising">Tracking the Trackers: Microsoft Advertising</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tracking technologies that do not rely on cookies are often referred to as “supercookies,” and they are widely viewed as unsavory in the computer security community because they continue tracking even when a user clears her cookies to preserve privacy. Sometimes a site will use a supercookie to “respawn” its original identifier cookie, creating a “zombie cookie” — the basis of several lawsuits.</p>
<p>Microsoft uses cookie syncing to share identifiers across many of its web properties, including bing.com, microsoft.com, msn.com, live.com, and xbox.com. Microsoft also syncs its MUID cookie to atdmt.com, the domain for its Atlas third-party advertising network. We found that one of Microsoft’s cookie syncing scripts (wlHelper.js) included an instruction to set the MUID cookie, and the script would get cached indefinitely.3 If the cached script ran and no MUID cookie was present, the script would set a cookie with its stored MUID.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETags</a> are a simple cache control mechanism built into HTTP. A website can assign a version number to a resource; when the browser goes to request the resource, and the version hasn’t changed, the website can just tell the browser to use its cached copy. It had long been known that, instead of storing a version number, an ETag could be used to store a user identifier (an “ETag cookie”). Two weeks ago a research team at University of Caliornia, Berkeley discovered the first instance of ETag cookies in use.</p>
<p>We found that, in addition to functioning as a cache cookie, Microsoft’s wlHelper.js script was associated with an ETag cookie containing the MUID.</p>

<p>From <a class="reference external" href="https://www.accessnow.org/aibt/faq/">Am I Being Tracked? - Frequently Asked Questions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>What is a UID header?</strong></p>
<p>UIDH stands for “Unique Identifier Header.” When you visit a website on your phone or computer, you typically send certain information to the website provider identifying your IP address, the software you’re using to browse the web, and more.</p>
<p>UIDH’s are “perma-cookies” that some mobile carriers inject into the information you’re sending when you surf the web. Mobile carriers use these unique identifiers to track the websites you visit, sometimes to share that data with third parties and other times for unknown reasons. Normal cookies allow users to maintain control, while perma-cookies are injected beyond reach, out of control of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Can my provider track me if I’m using an SSL connection?</strong></p>
<p>HTTPS sites use Secure Socket Layer encryption (SSL) which, in addition to helping to secure your online communications, prevent the UID header from being injected. The UID tracker mechanism is not effective in HTTPS connections. Unfortunately, millions of sites on the internet do not use SSL protection.</p>

<p><strong>Proprietary software: the driver of unprecedented surveillance</strong></p>
<p>“The reason that we are subject now to more surveillance than there was in the Soviet Union is that digital technology made it possible,” he says. “And the first disaster of digital technology was proprietary software that people would install and run on their own computers, and they wouldn’t know what it was doing.</p>
<p>“They can’t tell what it’s doing. And that is the first injustice that I began fighting in 1983: proprietary software, software that is not free, that the users don’t control.”</p>
<p><strong>Spying on the user: Swindle, Shitbit and the Internet of Stings</strong></p>
<p>“This is an example: this is Amazon’s e-book reader, the Amazon Swindle. It transmits, from time-to-time, the name of the book being read and the page number to Amazon servers. If the user enters any notes, they’re sent to Amazon too. Total Orwellian surveillance of the user,” he says. “I refuse to be oppressed this way: take that Swindle and step on it.”</p>
<p>But Amazon isn’t the only one collecting such intimate data.</p>
<p>“Lots of proprietary programs spy. Windows spies, Mac OS spies, iOS spies, Flash player spies. Thousands of apps spy on the user,” he says.</p>
<p>The proliferation of personal fitness trackers has, according to Stallman, amplified this.</p>
<p><strong>Software backdoors: Stalin’s dream?</strong></p>
<p>“The Amazon Swindle has a backdoor for erasing books. We saw this in 2009: Amazon remotely erased thousands of books, thousands of copies of the same book: it was 1984 by George Orwell,” he said. “So of course this stimulated a lot of criticism, so Amazon said it would never do this again, unless ordered to by the state. Right.</p>
<p>“Windows has had a universal backdoor since Windows XP: a universal backdoor means they can forcibly change the software at a distance,” he says.</p>
<p>“Portable phones, every portable phone has a universal backdoor,” he says. “So what is a mobile phone? It tracks a person’s movements all the time, it has to do that in order to function, but the effect is that the phone company finds always where it is, and can localise it very precisely by triangulating with local towers.</p>
<p>“And with the backdoor they can convert it into a full-time listening device that can hear all the conversation in the room, even when it’s not making any call, even when it’s supposed to be switched off.”</p>
<p>For Stallman, this is reality that the architects of the Soviet Union would have loved.</p>
<p>“I call this Stalin’s dream: this is what Stalin would have yearned for,” he said. “But the point is: Stalin couldn’t do that: it was too far-fetched even for him to dream of. But this is what’s happening today.”</p>

<div><p>We went thirty years – most of my time in the field – without any plausible C successor, nor any real vision of what a post-C technology platform for systems programming might look like. Now we have two such visions…</p>
<p>…and there is another. I have a friend working on a language he calls “Cx” which is C with minimal changes for type safety; the goal of his project is explicitly to produce a code lifter that, with minimal human assistance, can pull up legacy C codebases.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So, now I can see three plausible paths out of C. Two years ago I couldn’t see any. I repeat: this is huge.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is now possible to glimpse a future in which all that code is written in specific C replacements with strong memory-safety properties. Go, or Rust, or Cx – any way you slice it, C’s hold is slipping. Like, if I were clean-starting an NTP implementation today, I’d do it in Go without any hesitation at all.</p>

<p>From <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/11/14/Fearless-Concurrency-In-Firefox-Quantum.html">Fearless Concurrency in Firefox Quantum</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>These days, Rust is used for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/friends.html">all kinds of things</a>. But its founding application was <a class="reference external" href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>, an experimental browser engine.</p>
<p>Now, after years of effort, a major part of Servo is shipping in production: Mozilla is releasing <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/">Firefox Quantum!</a></p>
<p><strong>Stylo: a parallel CSS engine</strong></p>
<p>Firefox Quantum includes Stylo, a pure-Rust CSS engine that makes full use of Rust’s “<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">Fearless Concurrency</a>” to speed up page styling. It’s the first major component of Servo to be integrated with Firefox, and is a major milestone for Servo, Firefox, and Rust. It replaces approximately 160,000 lines of C++ with 85,000 lines of Rust.</p>
<p><strong>Fearless concurrency</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Rust guarantees that it is impossible to mutate the style of the parent element, because it is kept behind an immutable reference. Rayon’s scoped threading functionality makes sure that there is no way for that struct to even obtain/store a mutable reference if it wanted to. The parent style is something which one thread was allowed to write to to create (when the parent element was being processed), after which everyone is only allowed to read from it. You’ll notice that the reference is a zero-overhead “borrowed pointer”, not a reference counted pointer, because Rust and Rayon let you share data across threads without needing reference counting when they can guarantee that the data will be alive at least as long as the thread.</p>
<p><strong>Rust’s productivity</strong></p>
<p>A conversation amongst Firefox developers that stuck with me — one that was included in Josh Matthews’ <a class="reference external" href="https://www.joshmatthews.net/rbr17">talk</a> at Rust Belt Rust — was</p>
<p>… &lt;heycam&gt; can you imagine if we needed to implement this all in C++ in the timeframe we have</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>Overall, Firefox Quantum benefits significantly from Stylo, and thus from Rust. Not only does it speed up page load, but it also speeds up interaction times since styling information can be recalculated much faster, making the entire experience smoother.</p>
<p>But Stylo is only the beginning. There are two major Rust integrations getting close to the end of the pipeline. One is integrating <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/servo/webrender/">Webrender</a> into Firefox; Webrender <a class="reference external" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/">heavily uses the GPU to speed up rendering</a>. Another is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>, a project that offloads font rendering to the GPU. And beyond those, there remains Servo’s parallel layout and DOM work, which are continuing to grow and improve. Firefox has a very bright future ahead.</p>

<p>From <a class="reference external" href="https://research.google.com/pubs/pub46437.html">Data breaches, phishing, or malware? Understanding the risks of stolen credentials</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As the digital footprint of Internet users expands to encompass social networks, financial records, and data stored in the cloud, often a single account underpins the security of this entire identity—an email address. This root of trust is jeopardized by the exposure of a victim’s email password or recovery questions. Once subverted, a hijacker can reset a victim’s passwords to other services as a stepping stone attack; download all of the victim’s private data; remotely wipe the victim’s data and backups; or impersonate the victim to spew out spam or worse.</p>
<p>Our study captures three market segments: (1) forums that trade credential leaks exposed via data breaches; (2) phishing kits that deceive users into submitting their credentials to fake login pages; and (3) off-the-shelf keyloggers that harvest passwords from infected machines.</p>
<p>Over the course of March, 2016–March, 2017, we identify 788,000 potential victims of keylogging; 12.4 million potential victims of phishing; and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed by data breaches.</p>
<p>We find that the risk of a full email takeover depends significantly on how attackers first acquire a victim’s (re-used) credentials. Using Google as a case study, we observe only 7% of victims in third-party data breaches have their current Google password exposed, compared to 12% of keylogger victims and 25% of phishing victims. Hijackers also have varying success at emulating the historical login behavior and device profile of targeted accounts. We find victims of phishing are 400x more likely to be successfully hijacked compared to a random Google user. In comparison, this rate falls to 10x for data breach victims and roughly 40x for keylogger victims. This discrepancy results from phishing kits actively stealing risk profile information to impersonate a victim, with 83% of phishing kits collecting geolocations, 18% phone numbers, and 16% User-Agent data.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, we find 4,069 distinct phishing kits and 52 keyloggers were responsible for the active attacks in our year-long monitoring sample. The most popular phishing kit—a website emulating Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail logins—was used by 2,599 blackhat actors to steal 1.4 million credentials. Likewise, the most popular keylogger—HawkEye—was used by 470 blackhat actors to generate 409,000 reports of user activity on infected devices. We find the operators of both phishing kits and keyloggers concentrate in Nigeria, followed by other nations in Africa and South-East Asia.</p>
<p>Immediate solutions to the shortcomings of risk profiles include migrating users to unphishable two-factor authentication (2FA) or password managers that associate credentials with specific domains. While these schemes are susceptible to malware, our results suggest that the threat posed by credential leaks and phishing is orders of magnitude larger than keyloggers at present. Nevertheless, as Bonneau et al. point out, there are various barriers to adopting 2FA and password managers with respect to ease-of-use, recovery from loss, and trusting third parties [3]. Likewise, user knowledge of these schemes is spotty [1,23]. Our own results indicate that less than 3.1% who fall victim to hijacking subsequently enable any form of two-factor authentication after recovering their account. As such, user education remains a major initiative for enhancing account security.</p>
<p>In this work we presented the first longitudinal measurement study of how miscreants obtain stolen credentials and subsequently bypass risk-based authentication schemes to hijack a victim’s account. In total, we identified 788,000 potential victims of off-the-shelf keyloggers; 12.4 million potential victims of phishing kits; and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches and traded on blackmarket forums. Through a combination of password re-use across thousands of online services and targeted collection, we estimated 7–25% of stolen passwords in our dataset would enable an attacker to log in to a victim’s Google account and thus take over their online identity due to transitive trust. However, we showed how blocking login attempts that fail to match a user’s historical login behavior or device profile help mitigate the risk of data breaches and keyloggers, and to a lesser extent phishing. We are now using these insights to improve our login defenses for all users. Our findings illustrate the global reach of the underground economy surrounding credential theft and the need to educate users about password managers and unphishable two-factor authentication as a potential solution.</p>

<h3>11.16.2.4. Dark Cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#dark-cloud" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/cloud-leak-centcom">Dark Cloud: Inside The Pentagon’s Leaked Internet Surveillance Archive</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>The Discovery</strong></p>
<p>On September 6th, 2017, UpGuard Director of Cyber Risk Research Chris Vickery discovered three Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage buckets configured to allow any <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">AWS global authenticated user</a> to browse and download the contents; AWS accounts of this type can be <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">acquired with a free sign-up</a>. The buckets’ AWS subdomain names - “centcom-backup,” “centcom-archive,” and “pacom-archive” - provide an immediate indication of the data repositories’ significance. CENTCOM refers to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.centcom.mil/">US Central Command</a>, based in Tampa, Fla. and responsible for US military operations from East Africa to Central Asia, including the Iraq and Afghan Wars. PACOM is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pacom.mil/">US Pacific Command</a>, headquartered in Aiea, HI and covering East, South, and Southeast Asia, as well as Australia and Pacific Oceania.</p>
<p>Taken together, this disparate collection of data appears to constitute an ingestion engine for the bulk collection of internet posts - organizing a mass quantity of data into a searchable form.</p>
<p>This vast repository ingested content from a broad array of webpages; while Facebook is a popular, recurring host, everything from soccer discussion groups to video game forums are sources for scraped web posts. The posts themselves are in many different languages, but with an emphasis on Arabic, Farsi (spoken in Iran and Afghanistan), and a number of Central and South Asian dialects spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>The Significance</strong></p>
<p>Given the enormous size of these data stores, a cursory search reveals a number of foreign-sourced posts that either appear entirely benign, with no apparent ties to areas of concern for US intelligence agencies, or ones that originate from American citizens, including a vast quantity of Facebook and Twitter posts, some stating political opinions.</p>
<p>The collection of public internet posts in massive repositories by the Defense Department for unclear reasons is one matter; the lack of care taken to secure them is another. The CENTCOM and PACOM CSTAR cyber risk scores of <a class="reference external" href="https://app.upguard.com/webscan?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.centcom.mil%2F">542</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://app.upguard.com/webscan?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pacom.mil%2F">409</a> provide some indication of gaps in the armor of two major military organizations’ digital defenses. The possible misuse or exploitation of this data, perhaps against internet users in foreign countries wracked by civil violence, is a troubling possibility, as is the presence of US citizens’ internet content in buckets associated with US military intelligence operations. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the military from “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/attack-posse-comitatus?redirect=blog/speakeasy/attack-posse-comitatus">being used as a tool for law enforcement, except in situations of explicit national emergency based on express authorization from Congress</a>,” but as seen in recent years, this separation has been eroded.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, the same issues of cyber risk driving insecurity across the landscape are present here, too. A simple permission settings change would have meant the difference between these data repositories being revealed to the wider internet, or remaining secured. If critical information of a highly sensitive nature cannot be secured by the government - or by third-party vendors entrusted with the information - the consequences will affect not only whatever government organizations and contractors that are responsible, but anybody whose information or internet posts were targeted through this program, potentially resulting in unfair bias or unwarranted actions against the post creator.</p>
